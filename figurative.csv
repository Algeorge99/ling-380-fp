"I sincerely hope last night was just an off night as I have been here twice before and had great experiences. Last night was not one of them. Three problems -1. the white bean and kale soup was thin and under-seasoned - very weak\/watery. It was a rather bland broth with a handful of beans and some chopped kale. I realize it may have been a vegetable broth but something was seriously lacking. 2. The bruschetta bread was not grilled or toasted - it was just the bread brushed with oil. 3. not that big of a deal but usually they have two or three entree choices - but tonight they only had one. I love the location, vibe, and staff - and the owners have been very nice and gracious in the past - they were not around last night that I could see. I just hope it was an off night. We had out of town guests with us and were in a hurry so we didn't say anything at the time and didn't have time to re-order. I would expect that would have graciously fixed things or refunded a portion. Please stay on top of your kitchen guys! I want to keep coming.",2,2,2,2
"Just ate here for lunch today. I went with the Taco Salad with chicken. It was pretty huuuuge. I only ate half and I am ready to ktfo! I have 2 hours more of work.. let's hope I get through it without comatosing. 
  
  The taco shell is a chipotle shell.. wondering if it is homemade.. probably. My favorite part is the black beans & rice. I was thinking it'd be full of beans, but has a nice balance between the rice and beans. It also had grilled chicken and topped with iceberg lettuce, cheese and avocados. On the side were two containers of mild if anything, salsa. I do agree with Honey T. that $12.95 for a salad is just plain outrageous!! 
  
  I really wish they had their dinner menu at this time because that has soft tacos, teriyaki, curry, etc. 
  
  I did place a phone order, knowing it'd be busy. They told me it would be ready in about 25 mins. I thought that was a little long.. good thing I had called. It was pretty busy in this small little cafe. It is very modern looking. Most of the tables were full. They had my phone order all ready to go when I arrived there about 10 mins early.
  
  I had been here a couple years ago when they had first opened and I noticed their food really has improved since I last ate there. When I first went there, I got some sort of rice salad.. I didn't even see it on the menu. I can't really describe it being such a long time ago.. but I do remember it not being very good and me wishing I had ordered something else. My boyfriend got a panini and said it was okay. 
  
  They have also expanded from the last time I've been there and have a little bakery section and more tables. Very cool.. I think it took over a part of 8ono8 musubis. (man i miss that place!) 
  
  I have not tried any of their desserts except for their vegan cookies which are... ughhh.. like drugs!! They are soooo tasty and full of flavor and not to mention addicting. I can eat a whole pack by myself and they are less than 100 calories for 4. Not that I really count calories.. but just the fact that it is.. is pretty awesome in itself. I swear, better than non-vegan, hydrogenated oils, refined flour\/sugar crap like chips ahoy. They melt in your mouth and are sweet but not too sweet. 
  
  Will definitely be back again.. but probably will try their pastas and\/or give their panini's a shot again.",4,3,3,4
"Not sure what all the hype on this place is about... The ambiance is decent, I'll give them that. But the food was not good at all. Maybe we just got the wrong things? When I asked for recommendations from our server she gave us short, uneducated answers and had a bit of an attitude. Chicken fingers were about the same quality as the frozen ones at the grocery store.. I asked for ranch to hide the taste a bit and waited ten minutes for someone (not even our server) to bring it. Only to find out later that we were charged for it! We also got a French dip with au jus. Both the sandwich and dip were WAAAYYY to salty to eat. Disgusting. 
  
  Atmosphere: 4\/5. Decent patio, new building. 
  
  Service: 1\/5. Server did the bare minimum. Also should have warned us that they charge for ranch\/extra sauce.. I've always been warned by servers at places that do that. 
  
  Food: 1\/5. Chicken strips were edible but barely, French dip was beyond disgusting. 
  
  I might go again to try the burgers that everyone loves so much and give the place another shot, given that it's so close to my place, but my first experience was not good at all.",2,2,2,2
"During my first visit I probably would have given two or three stars. Nothing terrible happened but the service was pretty lackluster and the Mac and Cheese ""dinner"" was literally a giant bowl of decent (albeit standard) macaroni with creamy cheddar sauce.
  
  Having been back several times since that initial visit I have found that the service during my initial visit must have been an exception and that I simply need to order other items. I do love mac and cheese, but here it is better ordered as a side. I also appreciate that The Diner on Clifton is open late and serves part of their breakfast menu all day -- which is a big plus for a breakfast for lunch or dinner guy like me. I am also a fan of their shakes and will certainly continue visiting, especially if I have a need for a late night snack in the area.",4,5,3,3
"I have given this place way to many chances to impress me and every time I come out of there more and more disappointed. 
  We came here in early September before the concert and wanted to grab a snack. The dining area was not even packed. They did seat us down immediately and then crickets!! No one came up to greet us or even fill our glasses with water. We sat there very patient for over 20 minutes and nothing. How could you miss a party of 6? After trying to track down who our server was we left extremely upset on their customer service. I will not be returning back to this place. I have given it many chances and hoped it might make a positive turn. Sorry Hard Rock...You do not rock my world.",1,1,1,1
"Definitely not cheap. Food's good quality though.
  
  Had:
  Squid tentacles - Ordered because Yelp said they were good. They were pretty good, but the larger pieces were a little bit chewy. Good flavor though.
  Curry cuttlefish - Cuttlefish were really tender. Curry flavor was good. Awkward how they put fries into the bottom though. Steamed cuttlefish = steamed fries. Defeats the purpose of fries. Also filler. Less cuttlefish if you put fries at the bottom of the dish.
  Spareribs with black bean sauce - Definitely better quality ribs than I'm used to at dim sum. Other than that, pretty similar. Taro chunks at the bottom. Also filler.
  Fois gras and mango deep fried rolls - Think standard shrimp salad rolls at dim sum, but with small bits of fois gras and strips of mango inside, and the salad dressing on of the roll. Five pieces? Something like that. Not enough fois gras. Salad dressing overwhelmed the entire thing. That being said, it was tasty. Not worth the price though.
  Snow pea shoot and fried tofu steamed rice noodle - for all you vegetarians out there, this one's delicious. It's an interesting combination, and the mouth feel is quite nice. Snow peas are fresh.
  Snow pea shoot steamed dumpling - Supposedly had scallop in it. I couldn't find any. That being said, the snow pea shoot filling was almost (or actually) entirely just that. It was really tasty.
  Lion head beef meatballs - Or just big beef meatballs. A tad more black pepper in these than I was expecting, but it was quite welcome. Meat was tender. Very much so. Not much beef flavor though.
  Deep fried taro shred with minced pork filling - Usually yum. This one was also yum. Taro shred was nice and loose (not dense and packed in. More like deep fried floss?) and the inside was moist. Good ratio of external taro and internal filling.
  Garoupa and bitter melon pan fried rice noodles? - I think that was the name of the fish...Fish was delicious. Bitter melon was a good kind of bitter. Pan fried rice noodles were done well. Good base. Sauce made it so it wasn't dry. Good portion for six people.
  Durian pastry - An odd green color. That being said, the inside is quite strong on the durian, and entirely delicious. Custard-like. The outside was flaky pastry and oh so delicious as well. Three pieces. A great way to end my meal.
  
  If the prices were better and the service was better, I'd make this one of my go-to dim sum places. Well, that and if it was closer to home...",3,3,3,4
"I was very skeptical of this place because I am normally not a fan of strip center Mexican food places. This location isn't the newest and nicest but it is definitely a solid joint and far exceeded my expectations. 
  
  Our server\/waiter was fast, friendly and courteous. The chips and salsas brought to the table when you sit down were fresh and excellent. I especially loved loved loved the red one. I bought a pint to take home to put on EVERYTHING. There is just enough spice and great flavor. There is some secret ingredient but I can't place it. We also ordered the melted cheese thing for an appetizer and it was awesome cheesy goodness. Next time we are going to order it with green chilies. 
  
  My wife and I split the ""Fajitas for 2"" with 1\/2 chicken and 1\/2 steak. I thought it was excellent. The meat was tender and juicy and there were plenty of sauteed onions and peppers throughout. There was also more than enough for 2 people. The flour tortillas were also fresh and delicious. Their guacamole was less than stellar however.
  
  This is probably one of my favorite local Mexican places and I can't wait to go back.",4,5,4,5
"Loved the place. Froze my ass off dining outside as the indoor seating is limited. Although the Carne Asada street tacos were great, too much onion was a little over bearing so I will leave them off next time. We will be going back in the future.",3,5,4,5
"TIME is what you need when you come here. But it's worth it. Some may say the service brings new meaning to Lazy Mexicans -- but they are really just taking the time to make everything fresh! From the guacamole to the margarita, it's all done right before your eyes and it's worth the wait. The Tacos are good, and reasonably priced too. Just make sure you're not in a rush.",4,5,5,5
"My wife and I ate here twice in last 10 days. 
  
  After 2 recent strikeouts in local Restuarants we've frequented for years, this was a great find. Don't know what took us so long. 
  
  Great selection of Italian food, incredible taste, served hot and timely, great proportions. Also great service and vino selection. 
  
  Met the owner Tues night. Day before their cooler had gone out and they lost all their food yet she and staffed worked all day to get ready to serve their guests any way. Many other places would have shut down for the night. 
  
  Somewhat limited hours but maybe that's why quality so high.",5,2,5,5
"Came here last night with my boyfriend and I have to say if I were basing my rating on the service alone it would be 5 stars. 
  
  We started with the calamari, baked clams, and meatballs. The meatballs were absolutely amazing! They were soft, moist, tender and very flavorful. The calamari was a little too greasy for me but again the sauce was seasoned perfectly. The baked clams were mostly breading and didn't have that crispness on top that you look for. 
  
  We then split the Caesar salad which was very good and had nice sheets on thin fresh Parmesan cheese. 
  
  For entrees I had the Ossobuco which I was disappointed with. It was a little tough and the risotto was bland. My boyfriend had the chicken Parmesan which he enjoyed. 
  
  For dessert the peanut butter tart was delicious! 
  
  All in all not a bad meal, but nothing compared to the original back in Harlem.",3,3,4,4
"Showed up one evening for food to go and there wasn't a single employee in the building. One finally came from the patio and took my order. I asked for extra tzatziki sauce for my gyro. I was given my food and checked to make sure my extra sauce made it in, there was no sauce at all. Again no employee anywhere... So I went into the kitchen and asked the chef for sauce to go. 
  
  Food was ok. Service was horrible.",1,1,2,1
Nothing fantastic about this place. This is where you go when you now absolutely nothing about vinyl and just bought your first crosley player from Best Buy hahaha,2,5,5,5
"Showed up early for our romantic anniversary dinner reservation on October 9th, expecting to have a cocktail to find the bar was packed. That's fine, we went next door to Hecho. Upon our return, we were seated at a tiny table for two, in the packed bar! When asked, ""Is there something more private for us? This is rather uncomfortable,"" the host responded with, ""Well, since you made your reservation today, this is what we have for you."" Ok, that's fine, we'll relax and make the best of it. A server quickly came by, asking for our order yet, we hadn't opened the wine list nor reviewed the menu yet. After deciding what we'd like to order, about 10mins later, we waited patiently for our server who never showed after another 15mins so we left. We walked over to L'Atelier thinking we had no chance of getting a seat yet alas, we were seated and had another FABULOUS evening! Thank You and we'll be back to support the Joel Robuchon again in a heartbeat. Sorry Tom Colicchio. Cheers!",1,5,2,1
"I love greek food and took my mom and aunt there, my mom has never had greek food. Decided on this place, because my favorite place (Ambrosia) closed and all the good reviews.
  
  Food was Ok. We had the dolmas (good) falafel (good) gyro (meh) and a combo with chicken (very dry) and Kofta (burned, dry and tasteless). The Israeli salad on the combo was very good.
  
  When we got our drinks, we noticed a slimy liquid at the bottom (overflow) of the soda machine. We hoped the top of the machine where the soda comes out was better.
  
  It was not awful but there are a lot more places to choose from.
  I will not go back.",2,2,2,2
"The Rueben sandwich which I had today was pretty bad. The meat was salty, chewy and not layered on the bread. The bread was fresh, but the meat wasn't good deli meat at all. A neighboring table decided not to order it when they saw the sorry little sandwich. The onion strings were good. The TV's are nice, but they allow cigar smoking on the patio and that was truly obnoxious on this beautiful fall day.",2,3,3,3
"This place was surprisingly bad. The place looks really nice. From the outside you expect this place to have good food. The menu should have been the first hint. Not a lot of options, and even still, not a lot of good options. 
  
  I ordered the grilled cheese and tomato bisque. It took 20 minutes to make. Plane white bread with little cheese in the center. The bisque tasted watered down. Overall it was very bland. Trust me, you will get better food from the place further down the terminal.",2,3,3,2
"I wanted to love this place, but didn't. I chose this place based on the online reviews, it did not live up to them at all. Perhaps the food here use to be good, and the cook lost her passion -I don't know, but I've had good Czech and Eastern European food and this was not it. 
  
  Having recently moved back to Ohio from San Francisco I was looking for a place like I use to go to in SF with my Czech Friend Martina called ""Frankies Bohemian Café"". http:\/\/frankiesbohemian.com\/. The owner came from the same town as my friend so whenever we went, we got the hook up-all kinds of wonderful Czech food not on the menu but made for ""family"". I've been missing it something fierce, now so looked online for something here in Cleveland.
  
  I came across Marta's and it had great reviews on a number of websites. I was looking forward to eating some really good\/stick to your ribs food. Unfortunately this place did not live up to any of the reviews. 
  
  The décor was totally vintage 60s and kind of charming. It had an European tavern feel with tables on one side and a long bar running the length of one side.The owner\/cook\/waitress was very pleasant but sadly that was the best part of the meal.
  
  We got there at 6 on a Friday evening and the place was completely empty. Having been open since 4pm and completely empty on a Friday night at 6pm isn't a good sign for any restaurant. We wanted pierogies for appetizer and were told they were out of the pierogies (potato\/cheese) we wanted. Strike 2-another bad sign for a business that clearly wasn't busy and running out of food. So we ordered the other filings and our entrees. 
  
  Anxiously awaiting our food, hubby got a Czech beer (on tap). Plus for having a good European beer! Then we got our food and it was mediocre at best-a total letdown. The plate was piled high with food, covered in pale looking gravies-not very appetizing. I got the Chicken paprikash and it was tasteless and bland. I don't know what the other reviewers got who raved about it but there was nothing to rave about with mine. The sauce was very runny, pale and bland. The spaetzel was good though. Hubby got Pork Wienerschnitzel-said it was tough, WAY too much breading and a greasy gravy. We couldn't finish it and declined any dessert. 
  
  Not only was it so-so, it was pricey. One appetizer, two entrees, one beer ($7.50 for tap beer!) and one Sprite came out to $42 before tip. YIKES! Not cheap and not worth the money. . If you want good Czech food, this is not the place to go. I will continue my search for GOOD Eastern European food.",2,3,2,2
"This location really isn't a dueling piano bar even though it advertises that it is. It's basically a bar where two dudes play the same song together and take requests and try to be funny. 
  
  Most of the audience here are over 50 so expect a lot of older songs and older people being drunk. The drinks are overpriced, but that's also expected. Still, the menu is really cool looking as I'm a huge fan of Napoleon. 
  
  Overall, it was nice to experience it once, but I wouldn't come here again.",3,2,3,3
"5 stars for the food..... about 2 for the service. On a Saturday afternoon during a Pens game there was 1 worker. The place was buzzing and the bar was full. I'm not shaming them for being busier than expected, but how servers handle busy times is important. A simple, ""Hi, I will be with you in just a second"" could have gone light years in the situation, but instead we were blatantly ignored and sitting at a dirty table for 15 minutes and finally approached without so much as a ""Hello"". I had to ask, after someone from the back cleared the previous guests' drinks and check, for the table to be wiped down.
  
  I ordered the cobb salad with smoked chicken and my mom ordered the pulled pork quesadillas. Both were very generous portions and tasted delicious. The menu here is extremely impressive and I don't doubt most everything else tastes as delicious as the food we had on Saturday. 
  
  It's a really cool industrial - barnyard décor and I think this restaurant would do great in Lawrenceville or Bloomfield if they cleaned up their service a little bit and had more people staffed for the Saturday lunch hour. This is off the beaten path with (from what I know) little signage. Probably hard to come across if you don't already know where to look. I don't get out this way very often but is definitely a place I would like to bring Bobby back to try. I'd be happy to give them another shot..but this particular experience left me wanting more in regards to service at at a restaurant. So, just A-OK for now.",3,3,3,3
Place is clean staff are friendly and quick but most importantly they def make the best roti you can find in Toronto. We go once a month to satisfy our craving. If you like hear ask for pepper.,5,5,5,5
"Extremely frustrated, we like to go and enjoy their Happy Hour food but got turned away tonight because we had our grandchildren with us!!!!!! They told us Happy Hour is only for upstairs and you can't go upstairs with children. Last time we went with our grandchildren they honored Happy Hour downstairs due to having the kids...WE WILL NOT BE GOING BACK.",1,1,1,1
"This place has received plenty of positive reviews on YELP. I am not sure why. 
  I only came here for lunch because Ko-Mex was closed yesterday. From the outside, the place looks sketchy. However, I was pleasantly surprised at the clean and inviting dining area once we walked in the door. 
  
  For lunch, I chose the Moco-Loco which was layered with steamed rice, a hamburger patty, a fried egg, and brown gravy. I asked for my egg scrambled, not fried. Oh well - I ate it anyways. The dish was good--not great. 
  
  My wife tried the Korean noodle dish-Japchae. We didn't like the texture of the noodles they used for this dish. Imagine the texture of gummi bears while eating noodles. Because they were so spongy, no flavor stuck to them. Who wants to eat plain spongy noodles? Not this guy....
  
  My parents were with us since they were visiting from the Bay Area. They both chose the bibimbap (spelling?) which was a bowl of rice, vegetables, beef, an egg, and spices. The beef inside these bowls was bland, tough, and fatty. Oh, and the side of macaroni salad was way too salty.
  
  The service was spotty. For example, I didn't like that our entrees were coming out one at a time -every 5 minutes. Plus, I was not offered a drink refill at all during lunch. The more I write this review, the more I realize I don't really like anything about this place.",2,2,2,2
"Ambience. Thumbs Up.
  
  Cocktails and Wine. Double Thumbs Up.
  
  Food? Overpriced Mediocrity. 
  
  I had Ribeye and Escargot. While the escargot was forgettable, I'm a steak man. 
  
  American Diner Steak? Excellent. Just make sure to throw an egg on it to add some taste.
  
  Pocket Burning Steak? Double Excellent. I love the monthly piece that lets me indulge in my carnivorous pleasures. 
  
  This was a pocket burning diner steak. $65, hacksaw rough, slightly overcooked, and literally 1\/3 fat. Not in between or around the edges fat, but literally an entire piece of the cut. Screw that mess.",2,2,3,3
"Amazing live music...they even managed to squeeze me in without reservation letting me know they would need my table after 9PM. i liked the hostess honesty. Great group of ladies.
  
  Unfortunately same cannot be said for server or food here necessarily. I was feeling a tender steak and made a point to ask the server which of their Bavette or strip loin is most tender. He told me the strip loin...so I trusted him. The person next to me was having steak frites...his looked perfectly cooked medium rare. I got my steak. Well done to hell. I told my server and he looked at my well done cross section and said ""yes you mentioned medium rare..."" Mind blowing stupidity. I said its over cooked and not medium rare....he says in Canada it's medium rare...I said if this is medium rare...what the hell is well done? Charred to shit?
  
  Anyways he claimed I should have ordered it blue and brought me a newer steak. It was better but not medium rare. More like medium. Steak was delicious but the vegetables were so\/so.
  
  I'd recommend the place for live music and OK food. Not great for perfect steaks. Prices reasonable but the food I would sort of say is below par.",2,2,3,2
"Service was good. The server was very professional and courteous. The restaurant just got slammed - high school grad ceremony across the street just got out. It's Kelsey's so you expect pub grub. Four of the five meals we ordered were good. Sadly, I ordered a steak. Chipotle shrimp sirloin. Don't order the steak!! Omg. Worst cut of sirloin ever. I mean ever. You know the tongue of an old pair of leather dress shoes that have been worn for years and years? It would have better texture than the cut I had. Gross. And naturally, the frozen veggies boiled to ""almost thawed"" were a nice touch. 
  At any rate, good spot for pub grub and a pint. Typical for chain restaurants I would think. I won't order big there again, but I'd order the fish and chips or the Mac and cheese. Oh, and don't ask for a special request...it will be forgotten...could have been due to the slam, or order entry done wrong....meh...",3,2,3,3
"After a long day of shopping with the kids we had to stop at the food court for a potty break. While browsing at the after noon munchie options we decided to try this place Pita's which is also a Philly Cheese steak place as well. I did not know that one guy was running both outlets at first until I ordered at one and walked over to the other register and asked if I needed a cheese steak as well. 
  
  He was very helpful surprisingly. He made sure that I wanted everything I ordered. For example when we ordered the falafel he said ""you want the hummus, tahini, lettuce, tomato on the pita. most places will not explain what everything is like that. I am sure he did this because he probably gets a lot of people who order and are not really sure what they are getting seeing how this mall The Premium Outlets South is mostly for Las Vegas Tourists. By ensuring the order is correct when placed it puts the blame for mistakes on the customer instead of the business operator. Smart Guy!
  
  He did the same when I ordered the Cheese steak as well. He went through the ingredients including the cheese whiz like sauce that would be added to my sandwich. I also wanted lettuce, tomato, and mayo added and he repeated it back as well ensuring I was clear with what I was ordering. 
  
  The food came out at a decent time. They call out your number and you pick up the food at the other end of the Philly counter. The Pita sandwich was good, as well as the fallafel and hummus. They veggies were nice and fresh meaning the lettuce and tomatoes good bright colorful chunks. You could tell they were using fresh produce. My sandwich was a little small on the meat portion but it was delicious and fresh and made just the way I ordered it. I understand portion control consistency are important when operating a biz and meat is expensive. I am sure his rent at this place is Ridiculous!
  
  We finished our meal and our beverage so I went back to the counter to ask for a refill and he gladly took care of it. The guy even asked how my meal was tasting. Amazing! I thought the service we received was good. This man actually cared about our experience which is very important as a small business owner. This man get its. 
  
  The only reason I gave them 3 stars was becuase of the frumpy looking women sitting in a chair behind the counter. No smile, No hello, and no intention of doing either in the near future and on top ofit she was EATING! a wrap or sandwich right there in the food prep area in guest view. Not a care in the world. A big NO! NO! in my book. Everything else was good. Loose frumpy face....its killing your Biz my friend.",3,5,2,2
One of my favorite lunch spots. Green Chile is very good. New Mexico style. The green Chile burrito with beans is cheese is how I like it. Red isn't bad either. Chimis are delicious. Love the shredded beef tacos. But if you just feel like beans....get a bean and cheese burro. Omg the beans are so delicious. Home made just like they are supposed to be. Beware you will get very sleepy after eating. Not good if you are working after a good lunch here.,5,2,4,5
"This place is good for one dish and one dish only, so do not order anything else.
  
  The chunked beef noodle in soup is their specialty and what a good dish it is! My husband and I (especially by husband) really like this style of noodle and have tried many places throughout all of Toronto. This is by far one of the best places to have it. The beef is cooked to just the right tenderness even though it is we'll done. The noodle is thick and have the right amount of texture to compliment the beef. The best of all is the soup base. It is a flavorful and rich beef broth with some spiciness added to it that enhances the taste rather than overpower it. 
  
  During lunch a free cup of Hong Kong style milk tea is served for free. While not the best (that honor goes to marathon cafe at midland\/finch) it is slightly above average. The tea is not too dark and goes down smooth as it should.
  
  Like any other Chinese restaurant in the world, the priority is places on quality and price, not service. You come for food, not a chat with the staff. They are friendly but temper your expectations.",4,5,4,4
"Would I come back here? Hmm. Maybe not because I haven't tried The Loving Hut across from it which I hear has rave reviews (I'm eating vegan as much as possible these days).
  
  Maybe, if I wasn't eating vegan\/vegetarian that day and will cheat to eat a steak tartare (although I can just make it myself it's not that hard).
  
  I took a quiche and a tarte, and both were okay.
  
  FRENCH ONION SOUP
  The deconstructed french onion soup seemed a bit greasy (can see the oil on top), and was SO flavourful that when I went to go eat the quiche, I needed salt. A lot of it.
  
  I also wasn't a fan of the croutons soaked in there (I usually avoid croutons in a French Onion soup, as I just want the onions...!), but I did like eating a whole whack of mozzarella cheese melted at the bottom.
  
  Just found it rather greasy in general, or oily-looking.
  
  QUICHE
  The quiche itself was good and WAY better than at Patachou near Summerhill station (now THAT is an embarrassing place to eat because they pretend to know how to make a quiche but really have no idea it tastes like tofu for dogs).
  
  The only downside to the quiche for me was that I took the vegetarian option but the leeks made it all mushy. WIth leek quiches you absolutely need to eat them hot and freshly made, otherwise it just tastes odd. You're better off eating the ham quiche than a leek one that isn't fresh out of the oven. Just a tip from me to you.
  
  TARTE
  The tarte was also good but odd. I was somehow expecting something creamier and more like a firmer creme brulee but with fruit on top, and this one tasted more like the filling was ground almonds with blueberries. Still delicious, but it was rather tough (the crust was) and hard to finish due to my struggling with a fork.
  
  Is this the best French place to eat in Toronto? No. Go to Didier by St. Clair if you want to try better French bistro fare at lunch.
  
  Does this make decent desserts to eat? I've only had the tarte which wasn't so bad, but I still prefer Nadege by Ossington \/ Queen for pastries.
  
  Is this a decent place to eat if you're in the area, starving and with no other choices around as far as you can see? Yes.",3,3,3,3
"I never though that I could not enjoy a big bunk of lobster. But I guess it's possible. This place was just really pretentious without anything to back it up. Granted, we were a big group of 20-somethings but the place was pretty empty so I don't think a bad attitude was warranted. 
  
  I think the theme of the night was quantity over quality. The shellfish platter was full of giant pieces of seafood that tasted like it came out of a freezer\/buffet line. The lobster was really rubbery and flavorless, but it was cute that they de-shelled it in front of you. Perhaps I should have gotten steak at a steakhouse (who knew?) The creamed spinach and mashed potatoes were good, but nothing memorable. The creme brulee was really good (isn't it always) and the chocolate volvano souffle was also good. 
  
  But i don't think anything would compel me to come back here. Even the deco is stuffy and pretentious. Boys, come here in a suit.",3,3,3,3
"i had:
  
  tomato bread, sliders, fries, babyback ribs, and ham&cheese croquette!

"All food here is amazing! My favorite is the ""evil jingle"". I get it extra spicy. This means I will have exiting issues later, but it is totally worth it.. The staff here are very nice and on top of things. I love their accent. Love the environment here. Best Thai I have ever had!",5,5,5,5
"First the burger WAS GREAT! Can't argue that. But after all it is a $15 burger, it had better be, lol. The reason for the 3 star rating was the way they pile up extra charges without letting you know. After my kids ordered their plain ole hamburgers the witness asked if they wanted mushroom or bacon. They, being kids said, ""ok"".......They don't tell you that that added $16 to the bill by doing that. Actually they way she mentioned it I too assumed it was part of the meal, she never said that it was extra, but then again I live in Vegas and know how they underhandedly gouge visitors. Shameful. Gordon, you don't need the money that bad.",3,1,1,1
"I have NO business going to a French restaurant. I request everything sans beurre, sans frommage, sans lait, since my curse developed in later-life is to be unable to tolerate dairy (thank goodness it struck after an indulgent honeymoon eating through France.) However, my dear friend wanted to enjoy a French meal, so we wondered into Bardot Brasserie. First, I must say that the service was SUPERB, and to me, service is a make or break aspect to a meal. The waiter and wine attendant were both fun, knowledgable, informative, and just lovely. Although the chef had every right to be un petit perturbed with a no-butter diner, he and the waiter conferred to decide what could be best modified for me, after I preemptively declined the salad nicoise. Chacuterie plate with bread--yum! Blue crab buckwheat crepe sans butter--good, not great-- although I did sneak a pinch of sauce on top. Beet salad with arugula so good-fresh and nutty arugula with hazelnuts to accent the nutty flavor, went perfectly with the goat cheese (I had to have a bite of the cheese). My friend was practically cooing with pleasure from her escargot wrapped in pastry; she said it was smooth and buttery goodness. The suggested wine was a pleasant surprise. I'm not a white gal (well, white wine, that is), but completely enjoyed the nectar-y German Kabinett. Finishing sorbets--orange and mango--so fresh and clean and more fruit-filled than just icy. Great espresso. Overall, a wonderful, indulgent lunch and I look forward to going back soon. SO, if this dairy-free gal can enjoy it so much, I imagine how good it is for those who are unencumbered. 5 stars for my enjoyment at Bardot Brassiere. And, I never would have known it was the 3rd day open--kudos to Bardot Brasserie!",5,5,4,5
"This place used to be great. Its gone kinda down hill. Maybe I would have given it a four star but the disappointment of how good it used to be takes another star :). The food is no so so where it used to be so flavorful. The service has gone down to, it used to be young energetic waitresses. Now they look like retired hooker that don't want to be bothered.",3,2,2,1
"Opted for African Palace because Nazareth was good. Great little spot. Service was a little on the slow side but rightfully so as there was only a single waitress for an otherwise full house.
  
  Admittedly, I haven't had too much Ethiopian food. I had the meat platter and the flavours were great, particularly the goat. I could eat a whole plate of the goat, actually. Great for a vegetarian. The spreads aren't overly saucy so they won't completely sog the already spongy injera. It's also relatively cheap. $20 for 2? Why not.
  
  I'd return when the craving strikes again.",3,3,4,4
Had the special with chicken and the chicken was very low quality. The sause was nothing too special either. Had it for dinner and it tasted like it was there all day.,2,3,2,2
"We are visiting from out-of-state and decided to dine here for dinner since this place had good reviews and our hotel was only a few blocks away. When we arrived, the hostess brought us to a table upstairs even though the lively brightly lit bottom floor was mostly empty. The upstairs is VERY DIM that we had to use our cell phone flashlights just to read the menu! TIP: If possible, you may want to request a seat downstairs instead.
  
  We ordered (in order of our favorites): 
  
  1. Patatas Bravas (surprisingly sooo good!)
  2. Prosciutto Crostinis (our 2nd favorite with a good mix of sweet & salty) 
  3. Cherry Glazed Lamb Lollipops (these were good but a bit too raw for us so we asked for them to be cooked a little longer and then they came out perfect) 
  4. Market Mac & Cheese (our least favorite; kind of bland)
  
  Good, friendly service. Will be back again.",3,5,4,4
"This place is good and deserves a 3.5 stars but not quite enough to push it to 4 stars. The gyro was very big and tasty but was pretty plain. Contained meat, onion, tomato, and sauce. If you're looking for a quick tasty lunch, go here but i wouldn't say you should plan ahead to go here. Worth a try but not something i would go to on a daily basis.",3,2,4,4
"First time here. First hamburger in Canada since we arrived a few days ago. And our verdict:
  
  1. Pricey. Paid Canadian $ 12.71 about ($10 US) for a quarter pounder with American cheese, regular fries, and Dasani bottled water. 
  
  2. Burger came out quick...likely it was pre-cooked.
  3 out 5 stars.
  
  3. Fries came out a but greasy but with a good crisp.
  
  4. Service was great
  
  Overall, Five guys beats this place with both hands tied together.",3,3,3,3
"Grabbed some dinner tonight with the besties and it was a good night.
  
  We had the friendliest and most amazing server Eugene who tried his absolute very hardest to get my daughter to talk to him lol...she was acting really shy unfortunately. She was still too shy even when he brought her a little sundae. Sorry Eugene! Lol 
  
  Now the food...everything was just delicious! The wings were juicy and I got the hot sweet Asian flavour and it was sooooo good!! The amount of spice and sweetness was such a good balance and that's the flavour combination I like in a sauce. Let's not forget their famous garlic dull sauce...*drool* lol 
  
  The only downfall I would say was the Grilled Chicken Tostada Salad. Now it was a good salad, but I think it would have been a lot better if they used either head lettuce or romain lettuce. It was spring mix lettuce which gave it an off taste for this specific type of salad...just my opinion anyway. All in all, the dill pickle appetizer and even the fries were cooked to a nice crispness.
  
  I underestimated this place and I would definitely go here again.",5,2,3,3
"Finally a cupcake truck!
 
 While I wouldn't call myself a cupcake aficionado I've tried quite a few cupcakes in my time. These didn't make me go gaga over them. 
 
 I'm not throwing a hatercake at them but they weren't my cup of tea. 
 
 We tried an Almond Joy and Strawberry Fields 
 Props for both cakes being fresh and moist but they were too dense for my liking. The strawberry field had lots of flavor but was just too heavy. I was hoping that it would be a little more fluffy and airy. 
 
 The almond joy was a little lighter but I was hoping for more of the almond joy experience, it was a little light on the chocolate & coconutiness that you get when you eat the candy namesake. 
 
 Points on original flavors! 
 
 The only other downside was $4.00 was a bit much but I'm sure that i was jacked up a bit since it was at Vegas Streats. 
 
 I need to try the sweet potato pie before I cement by verdict ...",3,2,4,4
I went here during 4th of July weekend that saturday to see tiesto and it was way different than what I expected. The place was way too small and overcrowded by dudes. It was a sausage fest with maybe 4 guys to 1 girl. You could barely move around and everyone kept shoving you and even when I got shoved into a bouncer the bouncer gives me the dirty look for something that wasn't even my fault. If I could give this place 0 stars I would. Don't get me wrong tiesto was amazing but the guy to girl ratio was terrible.,1,2,1,1
"The two star ""I've experienced better"" rating is more than apt in this instance.
 
 The decor of Settebello is very nice and the ovens are cool to look at. It's really easy to get all jazzed about the wood fired oven and unique toppings and flavor combinations. Hell, the website does enough boasting about how original and special the restaurant is. But it all comes down to the food and this pizza just was not good.
 
 At the most basic level your margherita pizza should be the star. And it wasn't. The crust was flavorless and overcharred. Here's my unecessarily lengthy analogy: You know when you make grilled cheese (and c'mon, everyone makes 2 at a time, how could you eat just one?) and the first one comes out perfect but the second one comes out kinda messed up because the pan is probably too hot and there's not enough butter to help the bread brown correctly and the cheese doesn't fully melt because the thing is going to burn if you leave it on any longer? Well this is how my pizza was, it seemed hastily cooked over too high heat and lacked flavor. Not to mention the sauce was bland and the cheese was amorphous and too stringy. There was exactly one basil leaf on my pizza too and it was burnt to a crisp. All in all, a poor excuse for something so full of itself. Needless to say I was disappointed in a major way with this whole thing.",2,2,2,2
"The problem with Bandera is everyone waits at the bar prior to getting seated. Well how is that a problem you might ask since that is normal everywhere else...the problem is that they order their meal, are half-way through it and then move to their tables when called upon instead of finishing their meal at the bar. That's a problem because those of us waiting for tables can't get drinks at the bar since the bartenders ignore you unless you are seated at the bar. We waited nearly 45 minutes for a table standing around. The bartenders ignored you and it was impossible getting a drink. 
 
 The food was good but overrated. I ordered the por ribs and the meat fell off the bone. The fries were terrible and burnt little crisps..think of it like stale pringles... The service was polite and friendly yet not outstanding.
 
 A good restaurant for the Phoenix area but a lot of hype. This restaurant caters to the 40-60 year old White local Scottsdale crowd. I definitely recommend arriving before 7 PM and after 9 PM on the weekends otherwise you will wait 45 minutes for a table standing around without a drink.",3,2,2,2
Will never understand this community. Usually the people are nice when I walk my three pugs but sometimes you get those old white bitches lookin like they're from the Brady bunch and ignore you cause they think they the shit with their Skechers. Glad I moved out of this snobby community filled with wannabe rich white people.,1,5,2,5
"Nothing great...food just ""ok""....service mediocre at best. Noisy...making casual conversation difficult. Better places nearby in similar price range (i.e. Brio). In my view, it is not a relaxing ""go to"" place.",2,3,2,2
"I grabbed lunch here with my mom the other day and had a good time here. We wanted to get our grub on before getting our shop on at the Tanger Outlets. The restaurant had a cool vibe. I liked the interior mucho, ha! See what I did there? *cheesy grin*
 
 ANYWHO, we ended up ordering the Dance Marathon Enchilada (w\/ chicken, spinach, and portabella mushroom) and the Kristy's Big Sister's Red Velvet Quesadilla (chicken, grilled zucchini, spinach, pico de gallo and jack cheese). Oh, and I say ""we"" because my mom and I always split our food! 
 
 Let's start with the good. The quesadilla was AWESOME! Pipin' hot and perfectly cooked. I also LOVED the side of guac that accompanied the dish - probably the best guac I've had in years. FYI: it was a lunch special ($9.50) so it came with soup - you can also get salad if you wants. We went with the turkey chili, and it was RIDICULOUSLY tasty - lots of hearty filling with BAMF heat. 
 
 Unfortunately, my Enchilada was ""meh"". I feel bad because it was mad fresh with tons of grilled chicken and veggies, but it was tasteless. I had a really rough time finishing it. The beans and rice that came with it were even worse - pretty sure the rice was old because It was hard and dry.
 
 CONCLUSION: I'd definitely come back for the Quesadilla lunch special! I'd also be down to try the Fajitas out, but I won't be getting the Enchiladas anytime soon. Also, the happy hour seemed legit! Might be back to check that out with frands! Who knows...",3,2,4,4
"The food is good but the staff seems to be on autopilot. Not listening to the requests I made and then charging me even for things I didn't want or ask for.
 
 When I spoke with the manager he didn't seem to care what the actual issue was, only that he cared if I was going speak badly about his employees. He even stated "" what you want your dollar back"". With a condescending tone once he sort of heard what my issue was.
 
 On a side note, Betty at soups was very nice and helpful, maybe she should be in charge. Because of her this is a two star review instead of a one star review...",2,1,1,1
"Here's the thing. While the pizza is good and the other items on the menu have large portions, don't you dare need anything extra on the side from how your meal comes prepared. I wanted some balsamic vinegar for my pasta... $0.81. Would you like to add mayo to a sandwich, yup up charge there as well. Things most places offer for free you are nickel and dimed for here. I'm scared to ask for a refill on my soda... Well, just did. That will be another charge of $0.81.",2,3,3,1
"Sadly, they're one of the few companies in Cleveland for large-scale, organized recreational sports. It's a shame because, with a little effort by those who run Cleveland Plays, this could be a great, stress-free tool for everyone in Cleveland. Sadly, it's mostly an unorganized mess. 
 
 Generally, the schedules and scores are updated very, very late. Currently, our league page has not been updated for the last three weeks of games\/scores. While this isn't a big problem, it would be nice to have an up-to-date standings page during the season. This would take minimal effort from the staff to keep this updated. 
 
 There are some weeks they don't bother entering results. You'll have full sessions go by with missing scores. It takes a few seconds, but apparently our money\/fees don't cover entering all of the scores. 
 
 The referees also are wildly inconsistent, at least when it comes to indoor volleyball. It's frustrating for one referee to call nearly zero penalties the entire season, then for that same referee to call over a dozen per game later in the season. I looked over once and the same referee was watching the Indians game instead of our game, and, often asks the players to make a call because he wasn't paying close enough attention. Each team is required to pay $10 to the referee each game, so they make $20 to watch and referee a game for 40 minutes. This is on top of the already high league fees each session. I can't fault all of the referees for this, because there are other referees that do a great job. (EDIT 12\/6\/16: Most current\/new referees seem to be doing a much better job in the last few sessions!) 
 
 Their have also been instances in which schedules, which have been posted for weeks, were changed at the last minute with no direct notice to anyone on a team. There's also been instances in which they will schedule overlapping sessions - so, if you want to play a spring and summer session, be prepared to spend an entire night for a few weeks going to multiple games at different locations, because you'll have to jump between locations to get both games in (that's if they don't schedule your team to play at the same time at multiple locations). Fellow players have actually been able to reach a Cleveland Plays representative on the phone about a problem, were told they would get an immediate call back, but wouldn't get a call back. Generally, there isn't a response from the emails posted on their website, either. It's incredibly frustrating to have incorrectly reported scores or schedules that are posted and have to track down a staff member to get the information. 
 
 Don't count on any communications for cancelations regarding outdoor events, either. They'll often announce games are canceled after the games were supposed to take place, if at all. They recently had an 'announcement' (which was just a comment they posted under their cover photo of their Facebook page) that all volleyball games were cancelled at 6:30 p.m., but the games started at 6 p.m. 
 
 The website also constantly crashes\/isn't available. Any decent amount of traffic (such as though trying to check schedules because they're all updated last minute, or trying to see if a sport if cancelled for the evening) renders the site unavailable. 
 
 I can't comment on other sports (kickball, football, etc.), but if you can help it, go with one of the similar companies for volleyball.",2,2,1,1
"Originally, I wanted to go to my FAV ramen place (raku ramen and izakaya). Little did I know, THEY'RE FOCKING CLOSED. GONE. IM SO UPSET LIKE WHY MUST ALL NY FAV RESTAUrANTS LEAVE ME WHYYY. COme back Come back!!!!!!! ! 
 
 Anyways, enough of that. I went here instead to satisfy my ramen craving. For the most part, it was a relatively good experience eating here. I liked the fact that you can choose from 3 different soup bases (fish soup, hokkaido pork bone soup, and vietnamese style beef soup), whatever type of noodle you want, and whatever toppings you want. It's fun to customize food AYYYYY So yeah. I decided to get:
 
 1. Pork Bone Soup with Red Miso Ramen
 2. Japanese ramen noodle 
 3. Japanese Style Chashu and their Chef Papa Fresh made Fish Puff
 
 Pretty good. Soup was flavourful. Not too salty and not too bland. Ramen noodles were pretty good (a little hard though). Chashu could have been a lil better though. And the fish puffs, meh I didn't really like it. It was too squishy? Mushy? 
 
 I came here with my mom and she chose to get some pho noodles. LEMME TELL YALL . THEY WERE VERY GENEROUS WITH DEM NOODLES. HER BOWL WAS EVEN BIGGER THAN MINE. I WISH THEY WERE JUST AS GENEROUS WITH THE RAMEN NOODLES D;
 
 OH YEAH you can get a drink from Preso-tea for just an extra $2.5 with your meal which is pretty cool although I must admit I'm not a huge fan of Preso-tea. I am still very much in love with Coco and NOTHING WILL MAKE MY LOVE FOR COCO GO AWAY NOTHINNGGDJSIANS 
 
 BUT YEAH!
 Overall good place and it's definitely worth a try. Gotta mention though, I'm not too happy with their service. The workers were all so quiet and indifferent when they were with me and then when they were away from me (and other customers ofc) they were talking up a storm. So loud too like dang. Not that I want them to do small talk with me or anything, but I kinda wished they would've spoke up a lil more (go from volume 3 to at least volume 6 mate) YALL FEEL ME ?!",3,3,3,3
"I take great pride in finding the positive. The staff was excellent. Specifically Gareth and Eric. They were always extremely helpful, attentive, and extremely caring. I can't say enough great things about the staff. I genuinely feel they cared and delivered a friendly and hospitable experience. When Gareth and Eric came into our meeting room they always made sure the door didn't make a lot of noise and consistently went out of their way to be accommodating. They are the sole reason I gave two stars. 
 
 The hotel itself, the layout, and functionality? Absolutely hot garbage. In my opinion, this place is the epitome of trying to be too cool for school. First of all, there's no closets. Again, there are no closets - as in none. I simply don't understand this. Also, there is one drawer...in between the beds and could
 maybe for two books. Zero closets, one drawer. 
 
 The water pressure in the shower is the lightest thing I've ever felt. In fact, I couldn't feel it - it's non-existent. There were three hangers in the room hung on wooden sticks coming out from the wall. If I hung up half my clothes I block the tv. Just wasn't a comfortable or accommodating space. I also have kink in my neck, but maybe that didn't actually come from the bed. Maybe it came from looking high and low for any closet I could find. 
 
 The staff was great and caring, but whoever designed this place has not stayed there for more than 1 night. Either that or they didn't bring any clothes. I am grateful for the lack of functionality at The Moxy because it reminds me how much I appreciate functionality in a hotel.",2,2,2,5
