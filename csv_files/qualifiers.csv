"Service was incredible! Food was simple but not that impressive.The only thing that I considered to be absolutley exceptional was the Watermelon and Feta Salad! Also Ordered the Chicken breast and Wagyu Skirt steak was ok. I only think it was because everything was cold for some reason (30 minute wait for main course), but other then that it was just ok. Would have rather went to Jean George or Mastro's for the Price; and will also consider that when the option arouses.",2,3,3,3
Worst service ever. Food is really good but waiters don't know what they are doing and it's impossible to order pick up. It becomes more of a hassle to eat there rather than just being able to enjoy it,1,2,2,1
"I have never been disappointed. Food is home cooked, all entres are well portioned, and service is very good. It does not matter if you go to Dominics Pizza, JoJos Sports bar, or Dominics Italian Rest. you will be happy you went there. A life long customer.",5,5,5,5
"It's not my favorite sushi spot but it's very convenient down the street. I typically get a poke bowl. They are not like the ones I have got before but it fills me up for sure. Not a fan of the ceviche. Really big chunks of every ingredient and is only served with four tiny crostini's, which is clearly not enough. Very fresh tasting but not my cure for ceviche. Rolls are ok. Quantity of spicy salmon was great. Probably the best tasting thing I have had thus far. I have been here, 5 or 6 times. Hope better for next. I experiment each time.",3,5,4,4
"Yet again my first time visiting another lunchtime chain store; and I was not impressed really. The food was only ""OK"" and a bit bland. Plenty sauces to choose from if you know what you're doing; but it would need a lot to cover the tasteless food. I had the ""'lil bowl"" and a drink and with a side of guacamole it came to $9.68?! Wow...not good value for $$ in any language! The staff are very friendly and service is fast (it was empty for the most part at 11:45) Their credit card reader was also down so it was harder on them than usual They could give you a little more taco meat on the meal also. Don't think I'll be going back....",2,2,3,2
"not my favorite or even go to place 
  the food was nothing special 
  a bit over priced
  great location tho 
  the music physically was louder in the bathroom then in the resturant...not sure whats up with that",2,3,3,3
"So so. Definitely did not live up to the hype. Small portions and bland at best. I Wil say the rock shrimp app was fantastic though. The place is very tight and VERY loud. Service was average, definitely not anything exceptional. Place is very over priced for the portions and flavors.",2,3,3,2
"Not sure what all the hype on this place is about... The ambiance is decent, I'll give them that. But the food was not good at all. Maybe we just got the wrong things? When I asked for recommendations from our server she gave us short, uneducated answers and had a bit of an attitude. Chicken fingers were about the same quality as the frozen ones at the grocery store.. I asked for ranch to hide the taste a bit and waited ten minutes for someone (not even our server) to bring it. Only to find out later that we were charged for it! We also got a French dip with au jus. Both the sandwich and dip were WAAAYYY to salty to eat. Disgusting. 
  
  Atmosphere: 4\/5. Decent patio, new building. 
  
  Service: 1\/5. Server did the bare minimum. Also should have warned us that they charge for ranch\/extra sauce.. I've always been warned by servers at places that do that. 
  
  Food: 1\/5. Chicken strips were edible but barely, French dip was beyond disgusting. 
  
  I might go again to try the burgers that everyone loves so much and give the place another shot, given that it's so close to my place, but my first experience was not good at all.",2,2,2,2
"We have been here several times for Sunday Supper, but went last Friday night with another couple. The food was good, not great, but good. I think it is overpriced. it was so loud we had to scream at each other. The worst was when we got home my husband mentioned how much it was and I have to assume we got charged for wine that we didn't have as the bill was about $60. more than it should have been. I'm going to give them the benefit of the doubt and assume it was an error, but will not go back for anything other than Sunday Supper and will carefully check the bill.",3,5,2,2
"Cute space and decor - this place has potential. 
  
  The only reason I am giving this place a low rating because the food was not very good. I ordered the Shrimp Po-Boy, it came out cold and the complete opposite of what a Shrimp Po-Boy should taste like. The shrimp was small and cold, the sandwich basically tasted like a salad in a stiff baguette. I was so disappointed, I wanted to cry because I was looking forward to fried shrimp in a warm baguette. For $11 I would expected something amazing.
  
  Definitely not coming here again :(",2,2,2,2
"Definitely not cheap. Food's good quality though.
  
  Had:
  Squid tentacles - Ordered because Yelp said they were good. They were pretty good, but the larger pieces were a little bit chewy. Good flavor though.
  Curry cuttlefish - Cuttlefish were really tender. Curry flavor was good. Awkward how they put fries into the bottom though. Steamed cuttlefish = steamed fries. Defeats the purpose of fries. Also filler. Less cuttlefish if you put fries at the bottom of the dish.
  Spareribs with black bean sauce - Definitely better quality ribs than I'm used to at dim sum. Other than that, pretty similar. Taro chunks at the bottom. Also filler.
  Fois gras and mango deep fried rolls - Think standard shrimp salad rolls at dim sum, but with small bits of fois gras and strips of mango inside, and the salad dressing on of the roll. Five pieces? Something like that. Not enough fois gras. Salad dressing overwhelmed the entire thing. That being said, it was tasty. Not worth the price though.
  Snow pea shoot and fried tofu steamed rice noodle - for all you vegetarians out there, this one's delicious. It's an interesting combination, and the mouth feel is quite nice. Snow peas are fresh.
  Snow pea shoot steamed dumpling - Supposedly had scallop in it. I couldn't find any. That being said, the snow pea shoot filling was almost (or actually) entirely just that. It was really tasty.
  Lion head beef meatballs - Or just big beef meatballs. A tad more black pepper in these than I was expecting, but it was quite welcome. Meat was tender. Very much so. Not much beef flavor though.
  Deep fried taro shred with minced pork filling - Usually yum. This one was also yum. Taro shred was nice and loose (not dense and packed in. More like deep fried floss?) and the inside was moist. Good ratio of external taro and internal filling.
  Garoupa and bitter melon pan fried rice noodles? - I think that was the name of the fish...Fish was delicious. Bitter melon was a good kind of bitter. Pan fried rice noodles were done well. Good base. Sauce made it so it wasn't dry. Good portion for six people.
  Durian pastry - An odd green color. That being said, the inside is quite strong on the durian, and entirely delicious. Custard-like. The outside was flaky pastry and oh so delicious as well. Three pieces. A great way to end my meal.
  
  If the prices were better and the service was better, I'd make this one of my go-to dim sum places. Well, that and if it was closer to home...",3,3,3,4
"Overall, not a bad dining experience... but nothing was exemplary about it either. I'll go back.
  
  I am fairly consistent with what I order when trying new places that are similar to other places that I have previously been to. What I mean by that is that unless something is highly recommended by other Yelpers, then I will typically get the steak tacos at a Mexican restaurant... and that way I can, in my own way, compare each restaurant to the others.
  
  Anyway, there was only a very brief wait to get seated... and the service was really attentive, coming back to check on our meal, and filling up our waters often (always a big plus in my book).",3,3,3,3
"What a great place! My dining partner and I were both charmed by the ambiance, and we each took full advantage of their 2 oz. taster wines--it's such a great way to have a different wine with each course and still be able to go to work the next day.
  
  The food wasn't that impressive, though--I ordered a pasta dish that arrived oily and underseasoned, and my friend's chicken was similarly bland. We were very impressed with the post-prandial cheese selection, though, and the appetizer we shared was a lovely balance of salty (anchovies), sour (capers), and sweet (buffalo mozzarella). I'm glad there's a place like this in the neighbourhood, but I think I'll stick to drinks and appetizers here.",3,3,3,4
This review is for Road Kill Grill... The ribs were tasty enough but very dry & overcooked as was the brisket. The mac & cheese was forgettable just like the potato salad. The spicy BBQ sauce was the best part about the meal. I also do not like how you have to wait in the same damn room that they sell the butcher meat in which is already an extremely small place & the door is constantly bumping someone in the ass. This place is WAY OVERRATED. I have eaten from their truck before & for some reason it was better. The sad thing is that since that Guy Fieri said it was good on his Drive-Ins & Dives show every sheep in Las Vegas can't think with their own tastebuds... either that or BBQ has some really slim pickins in Sin City.,2,2,2,4
The food was tolerable..friendly staff also. They delivered within 45 minutes as was told. Taste for pricing: I wasn't too pleased. For a 24 hour delivery I wouldn't expect too much more than what I did. One negative thing is that I specified wanting sweet and sour and teriyaki sauce and they forgot but that wasn't a deal breaker I just wasn't crazy for the taste. Paid about 40 dollars for two combo plates.,2,3,3,3
"Came here last night with my boyfriend and I have to say if I were basing my rating on the service alone it would be 5 stars. 
  
  We started with the calamari, baked clams, and meatballs. The meatballs were absolutely amazing! They were soft, moist, tender and very flavorful. The calamari was a little too greasy for me but again the sauce was seasoned perfectly. The baked clams were mostly breading and didn't have that crispness on top that you look for. 
  
  We then split the Caesar salad which was very good and had nice sheets on thin fresh Parmesan cheese. 
  
  For entrees I had the Ossobuco which I was disappointed with. It was a little tough and the risotto was bland. My boyfriend had the chicken Parmesan which he enjoyed. 
  
  For dessert the peanut butter tart was delicious! 
  
  All in all not a bad meal, but nothing compared to the original back in Harlem.",3,3,4,4
"I love greek food and took my mom and aunt there, my mom has never had greek food. Decided on this place, because my favorite place (Ambrosia) closed and all the good reviews.
  
  Food was Ok. We had the dolmas (good) falafel (good) gyro (meh) and a combo with chicken (very dry) and Kofta (burned, dry and tasteless). The Israeli salad on the combo was very good.
  
  When we got our drinks, we noticed a slimy liquid at the bottom (overflow) of the soda machine. We hoped the top of the machine where the soda comes out was better.
  
  It was not awful but there are a lot more places to choose from.
  I will not go back.",2,2,2,2
"The Rueben sandwich which I had today was pretty bad. The meat was salty, chewy and not layered on the bread. The bread was fresh, but the meat wasn't good deli meat at all. A neighboring table decided not to order it when they saw the sorry little sandwich. The onion strings were good. The TV's are nice, but they allow cigar smoking on the patio and that was truly obnoxious on this beautiful fall day.",2,3,3,3
"I wanted to love this place, but didn't. I chose this place based on the online reviews, it did not live up to them at all. Perhaps the food here use to be good, and the cook lost her passion -I don't know, but I've had good Czech and Eastern European food and this was not it. 
  
  Having recently moved back to Ohio from San Francisco I was looking for a place like I use to go to in SF with my Czech Friend Martina called ""Frankies Bohemian Café"". http:\/\/frankiesbohemian.com\/. The owner came from the same town as my friend so whenever we went, we got the hook up-all kinds of wonderful Czech food not on the menu but made for ""family"". I've been missing it something fierce, now so looked online for something here in Cleveland.
  
  I came across Marta's and it had great reviews on a number of websites. I was looking forward to eating some really good\/stick to your ribs food. Unfortunately this place did not live up to any of the reviews. 
  
  The décor was totally vintage 60s and kind of charming. It had an European tavern feel with tables on one side and a long bar running the length of one side.The owner\/cook\/waitress was very pleasant but sadly that was the best part of the meal.
  
  We got there at 6 on a Friday evening and the place was completely empty. Having been open since 4pm and completely empty on a Friday night at 6pm isn't a good sign for any restaurant. We wanted pierogies for appetizer and were told they were out of the pierogies (potato\/cheese) we wanted. Strike 2-another bad sign for a business that clearly wasn't busy and running out of food. So we ordered the other filings and our entrees. 
  
  Anxiously awaiting our food, hubby got a Czech beer (on tap). Plus for having a good European beer! Then we got our food and it was mediocre at best-a total letdown. The plate was piled high with food, covered in pale looking gravies-not very appetizing. I got the Chicken paprikash and it was tasteless and bland. I don't know what the other reviewers got who raved about it but there was nothing to rave about with mine. The sauce was very runny, pale and bland. The spaetzel was good though. Hubby got Pork Wienerschnitzel-said it was tough, WAY too much breading and a greasy gravy. We couldn't finish it and declined any dessert. 
  
  Not only was it so-so, it was pricey. One appetizer, two entrees, one beer ($7.50 for tap beer!) and one Sprite came out to $42 before tip. YIKES! Not cheap and not worth the money. . If you want good Czech food, this is not the place to go. I will continue my search for GOOD Eastern European food.",2,3,2,2
"Was excited to try this place, but ended up pretty disappointed. Echoing what others have said, the beers do taste very watered down, so much so that we had a sip of each and that's it. Food wasn't memorable either, and 3\/4 of it came out lukewarm\/cool. The fish in the fried fish and tots was soggy and room temp. Overall, flavors weren't very good or special enough to warrant a return. It's also quite loud, I was really having to raise my voice to be heard by my dinner partner. It's a nice looking place for sure though.",2,3,2,2
"I never though that I could not enjoy a big bunk of lobster. But I guess it's possible. This place was just really pretentious without anything to back it up. Granted, we were a big group of 20-somethings but the place was pretty empty so I don't think a bad attitude was warranted. 
  
  I think the theme of the night was quantity over quality. The shellfish platter was full of giant pieces of seafood that tasted like it came out of a freezer\/buffet line. The lobster was really rubbery and flavorless, but it was cute that they de-shelled it in front of you. Perhaps I should have gotten steak at a steakhouse (who knew?) The creamed spinach and mashed potatoes were good, but nothing memorable. The creme brulee was really good (isn't it always) and the chocolate volvano souffle was also good. 
  
  But i don't think anything would compel me to come back here. Even the deco is stuffy and pretentious. Boys, come here in a suit.",3,3,3,3
"Caveat: I'm not a huge fan of Irish pubs. Irish pub food is generally uninteresting to me, and the food usually looks like dull glop on a plate. Not so at Piper's Pub. I went for Sunday brunch ~2pm, and the place wasn't at most half full. They have a great beer selection with a rotating list of good micros, & a special Sunday menu. 
  
  We went for Scotch eggs & the Smoked Salmon Boxty. The eggs took some time but my guess is that they were prepared fresh. They were good...but I wasn't blown away. Nothing against Pipers, I just don't think they're my style. Interesting though. 
  
  The Salmon Boxty...it was amazing. When I go back, I'll likely get the same thing...unlike me, but too delicious to pass up. It's more than filling so don't order anything besides an appetizer, or you'll feel like a fat kid. Think of it as a potato\/egg omelette...or just look it up on wikipedia for better description. Seriously though, get it. Your life may be changed forever.
  
  Also make sure to follow them on Twitter; they always announce their daily specials & newest beers on tap.",5,5,3,4
"um. not great. i ordered the chicken lo mein and the crab puffs - and well, was a bit bored. the decor is shady. and to be perfectly honest, if i'm going to eat chinese it should taste good - greasy and with a ridiculous calorie count but good.",3,3,3,4
"This is THE place for Dim Sum in Mississauga. Don't despair if you see a huge line up at the door on weekends, things move quickly. There is no rhyme or reason to the hostess numbering system...so just wait your turn knowing that it is going to be great food. The food is cooked in steamer baskets and walked around the restaurant on carts. Someone at your table has to take the key ordering position so as to flag down the cart and get the food on the table. The food runs out quickly, so don't wait for it to come around again, it may be a while or never! They do a great job with the staple DS fare: Har gow (shrimp dumplings), Shui Mai (pork) and sticky rice. My personal favourite is the scallops with garlic sauce. Try the Chinese greens, dumpling soup, and pork sesame seed buns. The spring rolls ( with meat filling) are awesome as well.
 The best time to go is just before noon on weekends or on weekdays. Anytime after 2:00 p.m. is pointless as they will be out of most food items.",4,2,3,3
"Meh. I guess if you were looking for a boba fix in Vegas, this is the best you are going to get. However I come from a land of the finest boba (rowland heights) so this is quite sub par boba.
 
 This place is pretty close to the strip and is in the heart of Chinatown in Las Vegas. The boba here is moderately priced, but good luck finding parking in this hellish parking lot. They just have your standard boba, but like everyone else, says if you are REALLY looking for a boba fix, go here. If not, save your money",3,5,2,2
"OK. This place is not good for groups. I repeat, not ideal for groups. I called this place for several days to make a reservation for my curious diners of 10 and not once was that phone picked up on the other end. Maybe the ringer was on silent! Well, we showed up, signed in and waited in line. I was nervous because I wanted all of us to sit together. 
 
 I got the attention of a waitress to tell her about our dilemma and she said, ""Yeah, we take large groups but you have to make a reservation."" Really? What a novel idea. Imagine my frustration. I told her to make it work. Surprisingly, our wait was less than half hour. 
 
 So, you could say we all sat together if only the conveyor belt was not running between our two tables. I guess it was the best they could do ""last minute."" Nonetheless, we made the most of it. 
 
 I was apprehensive about the service from all the reviews I've read, but I must say the waitstaff was on their best behavior. I thought they were friendly.
 
 I find that it's quite true about where you sit because most of the sushi we grabbed were cold. We were closer to the end of the belt! But we love the saki. We even did some bomb sakis for fun.
 
 Overall, it was a cool spot and a nice experience!",3,5,1,1
Nice decor. The service is okay. The food is not the greatest. The kabob is dry and simply not very good for Persian food on the pricey side.,2,3,3,3
"The Mee Goreng and the Pad Thai were good enough to justify a return visit, but the Mango Scallop dish was disappointing due to over cooked, chewy, previously frozen scallops. When we asked the waiter if the scallops were fresh or frozen, he seemed to not know. I will return, but I'll avoid the seafood.",3,2,2,2
Good Filipino mall food. Decently priced. The chicken adobo was not the best. It was bland and flavorless. The bbq chicken was excellent however!,3,3,3,2
"Their service deserved a 5 star. 
 
 The burger was bland, lacking in flavour. There wasn't that bbq smokey taste in the beef and all you taste is beef but none in flavouring. My husband tried the double burger with bacon and he said his was more bland but better than Five Guys. 
 
 I wouldn't go back but my husband would try it again.",2,2,2,2
"Nothing great...food just ""ok""....service mediocre at best. Noisy...making casual conversation difficult. Better places nearby in similar price range (i.e. Brio). In my view, it is not a relaxing ""go to"" place.",2,3,2,2
"I bet you suburbanites of ""America's most boring city"" love paying top dollar to get just decent Mexican food. When it comes to my search for great Mexican food, I just can't catch a break outside of the barrio. 
 
 I ordered the Killer Burrito. Beef, beans, guac, and sour cream. Possibly a bit of cheese. The tortillas are made fresh from scratch, and taste amazing. Their beef tastes exactly like it would from someone's home. The salsa was nothing to get excited over, but the fresh, hot chips were great.
 
 So you're probably wondering why I gave this two stars?
 
 The prices are a joke! If you don't believe me, laugh at this:
 
 
 Any plain burrito (carne asada, chicken, etc.) is $6, but if you don't like yours plain, it'll cost ya.
 
 The horchata costs $2.75, and it's the fountain drink horchata, NOT the real stuff.
 
 A quesadilla with carne asada, sour cream, and guac comes out to $11.00. Yeah, I made that face, too.
 
 My burrito was $7.50. 
 
 No, portions are NOT huge, they're the same as every other place. So in reality you're paying up to *double* the price for your meal (just think of that quesadilla!), and you're certainly not getting the quality to match. But does Mesa really have an alternative?",3,5,3,2
"I grabbed lunch here with my mom the other day and had a good time here. We wanted to get our grub on before getting our shop on at the Tanger Outlets. The restaurant had a cool vibe. I liked the interior mucho, ha! See what I did there? *cheesy grin*
 
 ANYWHO, we ended up ordering the Dance Marathon Enchilada (w\/ chicken, spinach, and portabella mushroom) and the Kristy's Big Sister's Red Velvet Quesadilla (chicken, grilled zucchini, spinach, pico de gallo and jack cheese). Oh, and I say ""we"" because my mom and I always split our food! 
 
 Let's start with the good. The quesadilla was AWESOME! Pipin' hot and perfectly cooked. I also LOVED the side of guac that accompanied the dish - probably the best guac I've had in years. FYI: it was a lunch special ($9.50) so it came with soup - you can also get salad if you wants. We went with the turkey chili, and it was RIDICULOUSLY tasty - lots of hearty filling with BAMF heat. 
 
 Unfortunately, my Enchilada was ""meh"". I feel bad because it was mad fresh with tons of grilled chicken and veggies, but it was tasteless. I had a really rough time finishing it. The beans and rice that came with it were even worse - pretty sure the rice was old because It was hard and dry.
 
 CONCLUSION: I'd definitely come back for the Quesadilla lunch special! I'd also be down to try the Fajitas out, but I won't be getting the Enchiladas anytime soon. Also, the happy hour seemed legit! Might be back to check that out with frands! Who knows...",3,2,4,4
"Pretty nice joint located inside of the Aria hotel and casino. The overall ambiance is pretty cool with a bit of modern chic""ness"" to it which makes it pretty appealing for the folks passing bye. The food is essentially tapas but are portioned extremely small and have somewhat of a bitter taste. There were some dishes that were solid, but others were honestly just meh. The drinks are good but are extremely stiff and the service is slightly above average. Not a bad place to dine, just wouldn't be my first choice. 
 
 Pros-
 Ambiance 
 Decor 
 Stiff drinks
 Friendly service
 Location (within Aria)
 
 Cons-
 Food is meh
 Small portions 
 Pricey 
 Lots of salt",3,3,3,3
"My shopping partner and I were at the mall when all of a sudden -simultaneously - we both got the urge for some beer and bar food. Hence, we found ourselves at the Yard House. It's in the mall. This was my second time (Indian Wells) and my friends first time. I told him that he was going to be in for a treat with the beer selection. Lo and behold they have over a 100 beers on DRAFT! It was a bit overwhelming so it took us almost 10 minutes to decide what drink to order. I got the Oregon honey and he got the half & half. Both of us were not disappointed. We ended up ordering several appetizers We got the sliders (ok, too much bread, not enough meat & side of fries), crab cakes (2 pieces, average tasting), lettuce wraps (grounded chicken with tofu, tasty), & the ahi tuna (unusually served as a round pie, good and super filling). This ended up being more than enough food for two people. It didn't stop there, though. We ordered the trio sample for dessert. We couldn't resist. It consisted of a small ramican of lemon souffle (yumm), chocolate fudge (yummier), and apple cobbler (heavenly). Overall, the service and food left us with a good stuffed feeling. I would definitely stop by and try it again. Unfortunately, we don't have one in the Bay Area. Wait, maybe that's a good thing?",3,5,3,2
"One of my somewhat regular stops. Bartenders always friendly and quick with the cold beers and stiff drinks. Poker machines haven't been kind to me. But when are they ever?
 
 It is one of those places where you order food and drink from different people and get different tabs. That confuses me because I am not that bright. Food is always fine, if not exceptional. But great stop for drinks, pool, darts and reflection on life's great dilemmas.",3,3,3,4
"We went here while visiting our son and grandson in Phoenix
 
 I cant say that I was too impressed with the meal. I got a beef tamale and 2 beef enchiladas which were OK but far from anything special. The Fiedo was pretty tasty and we both thought that the chips and salsa were good, especially the flour ones.
 
 Will we go back, possibly during happy hour for the free buffet and because the chips and salsa here are very tasty.",3,3,3,4
