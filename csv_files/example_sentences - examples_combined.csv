I decided on the fried strips and mac and cheese, and Heather S. got the grilled chicken strips with mac and cheese.

The food is fresh and good. Really how can you go wrong with breading chicken and frying it, they do seem to make it just that much more delicious. I love the fried strips, the panko breading was fried to a perfect golden brown, mmmmm yum yes..

My only thing is that I think they should give up the sauce more. That is a pet peeve of mine when a joint charges for or limits ""extra"" sauce. I mean they are called strip n dip chicken right?

I only ate half and I am ready to ktfo! I have 2 hours more of work.. let's hope I get through it without comatosing. 
 
 The taco shell is a chipotle shell.. wondering if it is homemade.. probably. My favorite part is the black beans & rice. I was thinking it'd be full of beans, but has a nice balance between the rice and beans. It also had grilled chicken and topped with iceberg lettuce, cheese and avocados. On the side were two containers of mild if anything, salsa. I do agree with Honey T. that $12.95 for a salad is just plain outrageous!! 
 
 I really wish they had their dinner menu at this time because that has soft tacos, teriyaki, curry, etc. 
 
 I did place a phone order, knowing it'd be busy. They told me it would be ready in about 25 mins. I thought that was a little long.. good thing I had called. It was pretty busy in this small little cafe. It is very modern looking. Most of the tables were full. They had my phone order all ready to go when I arrived there about 10 mins early.
 
 I had been here a couple years ago when they had first opened and I noticed their food really has improved since I last ate there. When I first went there, I got some sort of rice salad.. I didn't even see it on the menu. I can't really describe it being such a long time ago.. but I do remember it not being very good and me wishing I had ordered something else. My boyfriend got a panini and said it was okay. 
 
 They have also expanded from the last time I've been there and have a little bakery section and more tables. Very cool.. I think it took over a part of 8ono8 musubis. (man i miss that place!) 
 
 I have not tried any of their desserts except for their vegan cookies which are... ughhh.. like drugs!! They are soooo tasty and full of flavor and not to mention addicting. I can eat a whole pack by myself and they are less than 100 calories for 4. Not that I really count calories.. but just the fact that it is.. is pretty awesome in itself. I swear, better than non-vegan, hydrogenated oils, refined flour\/sugar crap like chips ahoy. They melt in your mouth and are sweet but not too sweet.

 The only reason I am giving this place a low rating because the food was not very good. I ordered the Shrimp Po-Boy, it came out cold and the complete opposite of what a Shrimp Po-Boy should taste like. The shrimp was small and cold, the sandwich basically tasted like a salad in a stiff baguette. I was so disappointed, I wanted to cry because I was looking forward to fried shrimp in a warm baguette.

 Had:
 Squid tentacles - Ordered because Yelp said they were good. They were pretty good, but the larger pieces were a little bit chewy. Good flavor though.
 Curry cuttlefish - Cuttlefish were really tender. Curry flavor was good. Awkward how they put fries into the bottom though. Steamed cuttlefish = steamed fries. Defeats the purpose of fries. Also filler. Less cuttlefish if you put fries at the bottom of the dish.
 Spareribs with black bean sauce - Definitely better quality ribs than I'm used to at dim sum. Other than that, pretty similar. Taro chunks at the bottom. Also filler.
 Fois gras and mango deep fried rolls - Think standard shrimp salad rolls at dim sum, but with small bits of fois gras and strips of mango inside, and the salad dressing on of the roll. Five pieces? Something like that. Not enough fois gras. Salad dressing overwhelmed the entire thing. That being said, it was tasty. Not worth the price though.
 Snow pea shoot and fried tofu steamed rice noodle - for all you vegetarians out there, this one's delicious. It's an interesting combination, and the mouth feel is quite nice. Snow peas are fresh.
 Snow pea shoot steamed dumpling - Supposedly had scallop in it. I couldn't find any. That being said, the snow pea shoot filling was almost (or actually) entirely just that. It was really tasty.
 Lion head beef meatballs - Or just big beef meatballs. A tad more black pepper in these than I was expecting, but it was quite welcome. Meat was tender. Very much so. Not much beef flavor though.
 Deep fried taro shred with minced pork filling - Usually yum. This one was also yum. Taro shred was nice and loose (not dense and packed in. More like deep fried floss?) and the inside was moist. Good ratio of external taro and internal filling.
 Garoupa and bitter melon pan fried rice noodles? - I think that was the name of the fish...Fish was delicious. Bitter melon was a good kind of bitter. Pan fried rice noodles were done well. Good base. Sauce made it so it wasn't dry. Good portion for six people.
 Durian pastry - An odd green color. That being said, the inside is quite strong on the durian, and entirely delicious. Custard-like. The outside was flaky pastry and oh so delicious as well. Three pieces. A great way to end my meal.

The calamari was a little too greasy for me but again the sauce was seasoned perfectly. The baked clams were mostly breading and didn't have that crispness on top that you look for. 
 
 We then split the Caesar salad which was very good and had nice sheets on thin fresh Parmesan cheese.

 Having recently moved back to Ohio from San Francisco I was looking for a place like I use to go to in SF with my Czech Friend Martina called ""Frankies Bohemian Café"". http:\/\/frankiesbohemian.com\/. The owner came from the same town as my friend so whenever we went, we got the hook up-all kinds of wonderful Czech food not on the menu but made for ""family"". I've been missing it something fierce, now so looked online for something here in Cleveland.
 
 I came across Marta's and it had great reviews on a number of websites. I was looking forward to eating some really good\/stick to your ribs food. Unfortunately this place did not live up to any of the reviews. 
 
 The décor was totally vintage 60s and kind of charming. It had an European tavern feel with tables on one side and a long bar running the length of one side.The owner\/cook\/waitress was very pleasant but sadly that was the best part of the meal.
 
  We got there at 6 on a Friday evening and the place was completely empty. Having been open since 4pm and completely empty on a Friday night at 6pm isn't a good sign for any restaurant. We wanted pierogies for appetizer and were told they were out of the pierogies (potato\/cheese) we wanted. Strike 2-another bad sign for a business that clearly wasn't busy and running out of food. So we ordered the other filings and our entrees. 
 
 Anxiously awaiting our food, hubby got a Czech beer (on tap). Plus for having a good European beer! Then we got our food and it was mediocre at best-a total letdown. The plate was piled high with food, covered in pale looking gravies-not very appetizing. I got the Chicken paprikash and it was tasteless and bland. I don't know what the other reviewers got who raved about it but there was nothing to rave about with mine. The sauce was very runny, pale and bland. The spaetzel was good though. Hubby got Pork Wienerschnitzel-said it was tough, WAY too much breading and a greasy gravy. We couldn't finish it and declined any dessert. 
 
 Not only was it so-so, it was pricey. One appetizer, two entrees, one beer ($7.50 for tap beer!) and one Sprite came out to $42 before tip. YIKES! Not cheap and not worth the money. .

 I only came here for lunch because Ko-Mex was closed yesterday. From the outside, the place looks sketchy. However, I was pleasantly surprised at the clean and inviting dining area once we walked in the door. 
 
 For lunch, I chose the Moco-Loco which was layered with steamed rice, a hamburger patty, a fried egg, and brown gravy. I asked for my egg scrambled, not fried. Oh well - I ate it anyways. The dish was good--not great. 
 
 My wife tried the Korean noodle dish-Japchae. We didn't like the texture of the noodles they used for this dish. Imagine the texture of gummi bears while eating noodles. Because they were so spongy, no flavor stuck to them. Who wants to eat plain spongy noodles? Not this guy....
 
 My parents were with us since they were visiting from the Bay Area. They both chose the bibimbap (spelling?) which was a bowl of rice, vegetables, beef, an egg, and spices. The beef inside these bowls was bland, tough, and fatty. Oh, and the side of macaroni salad was way too salty.
 
 The service was spotty. For example, I didn't like that our entrees were coming out one at a time -every 5 minutes. Plus, I was not offered a drink refill at all during lunch. The more I write this review, the more I realize I don't really like anything about this place.",1,0,0,1,1,0,0

While browsing at the after noon munchie options we decided to try this place Pita's which is also a Philly Cheese steak place as well. I did not know that one guy was running both outlets at first until I ordered at one and walked over to the other register and asked if I needed a cheese steak as well. 
 
 He was very helpful surprisingly. He made sure that I wanted everything I ordered. For example when we ordered the falafel he said ""you want the hummus, tahini, lettuce, tomato on the pita. most places will not explain what everything is like that. I am sure he did this because he probably gets a lot of people who order and are not really sure what they are getting seeing how this mall The Premium Outlets South is mostly for Las Vegas Tourists. By ensuring the order is correct when placed it puts the blame for mistakes on the customer instead of the business operator. Smart Guy!
 
 He did the same when I ordered the Cheese steak as well. He went through the ingredients including the cheese whiz like sauce that would be added to my sandwich. I also wanted lettuce, tomato, and mayo added and he repeated it back as well ensuring I was clear with what I was ordering. 
 
 The food came out at a decent time. They call out your number and you pick up the food at the other end of the Philly counter. The Pita sandwich was good, as well as the fallafel and hummus. They veggies were nice and fresh meaning the lettuce and tomatoes good bright colorful chunks. You could tell they were using fresh produce. My sandwich was a little small on the meat portion but it was delicious and fresh and made just the way I ordered it. I understand portion control consistency are important when operating a biz and meat is expensive. I am sure his rent at this place is Ridiculous!
 
 We finished our meal and our beverage so I went back to the counter to ask for a refill and he gladly took care of it. The guy even asked how my meal was tasting. Amazing! I thought the service we received was good. This man actually cared about our experience which is very important as a small business owner. This man get its. 
 
 The only reason I gave them 3 stars was becuase of the frumpy looking women sitting in a chair behind the counter.

 The chunked beef noodle in soup is their specialty and what a good dish it is!

The beef is cooked to just the right tenderness even though it is we'll done. The noodle is thick and have the right amount of texture to compliment the beef. The best of all is the soup base.

 Maybe, if I wasn't eating vegan\/vegetarian that day and will cheat to eat a steak tartare (although I can just make it myself it's not that hard).
 
 I took a quiche and a tarte, and both were okay.
 
 FRENCH ONION SOUP
 The deconstructed french onion soup seemed a bit greasy (can see the oil on top), and was SO flavourful that when I went to go eat the quiche, I needed salt. A lot of it.
 
 I also wasn't a fan of the croutons soaked in there (I usually avoid croutons in a French Onion soup, as I just want the onions...!), but I did like eating a whole whack of mozzarella cheese melted at the bottom.
 
 Just found it rather greasy in general, or oily-looking.
 
 QUICHE
 The quiche itself was good and WAY better than at Patachou near Summerhill station (now THAT is an embarrassing place to eat because they pretend to know how to make a quiche but really have no idea it tastes like tofu for dogs).
 
 The only downside to the quiche for me was that I took the vegetarian option but the leeks made it all mushy. WIth leek quiches you absolutely need to eat them hot and freshly made, otherwise it just tastes odd. You're better off eating the ham quiche than a leek one that isn't fresh out of the oven. Just a tip from me to you.
 
 TARTE
 The tarte was also good but odd. I was somehow expecting something creamier and more like a firmer creme brulee but with fruit on top, and this one tasted more like the filling was ground almonds with blueberries. Still delicious, but it was rather tough (the crust was) and hard to finish due to my struggling with a fork.
 
 Is this the best French place to eat in Toronto? No. Go to Didier by St. Clair if you want to try better French bistro fare at lunch.
 
 Does this make decent desserts to eat? I've only had the tarte which wasn't so bad, but I still prefer Nadege by Ossington \/ Queen for pastries.

Chacuterie plate with bread--yum! Blue crab buckwheat crepe sans butter--good, not great-- although I did sneak a pinch of sauce on top. Beet salad with arugula so good-fresh and nutty arugula with hazelnuts to accent the nutty flavor, went perfectly with the goat cheese (I had to have a bite of the cheese). My friend was practically cooing with pleasure from her escargot wrapped in pastry; she said it was smooth and buttery goodness. The suggested wine was a pleasant surprise. I'm not a white gal (well, white wine, that is), but completely enjoyed the nectar-y German Kabinett. Finishing sorbets--orange and mango--so fresh and clean and more fruit-filled than just icy.

They advertise a breakfast deal for 4.95$ comprised of 2 eggs any style, a bagel or toast and a small coffee or tea. The first time I came here, I ordered just that and it was fine.
 
 Today, I decided to try out their omelette. I ordered the omelette with onions and cheddar cheese, roasted potatoes for an additional 0.50$ (have the option of a salad or sweet potatoes), a bagel and a tea to go. It all came to about 14$. Everything smelled really great and I was really looking forward to having a nice and filling breakfast. 
 
 As usual, their bagel was delicious - I have nothing to say about that. However, when it came to the eggs and roasted potatoes, there was waaaaaay too much oil. My mom tried one piece of the potatoes and wouldn't finish it, since she found it too oily. I was really hungry and ate about half of the omelette and the potatoes. Boy do I regret that. I don't think I tasted much of the cheese, but there was a hefty amount of onions (which I appreciate). Right before writing this review I had to take some tums. In retrospect, I should have probably either stuck to their plain eggs or ordered an egg white omelette (big maybe though). Either way, I would never order the potatoes again. 
 
 I will most definitely come back for their bagels, as they are absolutely delicious. But, I would order their omelettes with caution or not at all.

All in all, the dill pickle appetizer and even the fries were cooked to a nice crispness.

While I wouldn't call myself a cupcake aficionado I've tried quite a few cupcakes in my time. These didn't make me go gaga over them.

We tried an Almond Joy and Strawberry Fields 
Props for both cakes being fresh and moist but they were too dense for my liking. The strawberry field had lots of flavor but was just too heavy. I was hoping that it would be a little more fluffy and airy. 

The almond joy was a little lighter but I was hoping for more of the almond joy experience, it was a little light on the chocolate & coconutiness that you get when you  eat the candy namesake.

Mattress was very, very squishy; Possibly just old, or maybe low quality. One side was much firmer (and in the direct path of the A\/C) I gave that to my girlfriend :)

We had a couple flying insect ""attacks."" There was a large wasp-looking thing hanging out behind the mirror in the bathroom, who decided to come out and freak out my girlfriend as she was brushing her teeth. We also had a few flies hanging around the room and annoying us in the evening. I suspect the not-so-great seal around the window air-conditioner unit.

Also, the DTV in the rooms was interesting, as we'd never experienced the free over-the-air DTV thing, and I'm sure that saves the motel money on cable... but there's only about 10 channels, or less depending on what time of day it is.

On the positive side, the staff was very friendly and recommended a good breakfast stop for us. The room was an OK size and it seemed clean enough. Free wireless internet (though slightly weak signal) was a nice perk. Mini-fridge kept stuff super cold.

Hell, the website does enough boasting about how original and special the restaurant is. But it all comes down to the food and this pizza just was not good.

At the most basic level your margherita pizza should be the star. And it wasn't. The crust was flavorless and overcharred. Here's my unecessarily lengthy analogy: You know when you make grilled cheese (and c'mon, everyone makes 2 at a time, how could you eat just one?) and the first one comes out perfect but the second one comes out kinda messed up because the pan is probably too hot and there's not enough butter to help the bread brown correctly and the cheese doesn't fully melt because the thing is going to burn if you leave it on any longer? Well this is how my pizza was, it seemed hastily cooked over too high heat and lacked flavor. Not to mention the sauce was bland and the cheese was amorphous and too stringy. There was exactly one basil leaf on my pizza too and it was burnt to a crisp. All in all, a poor excuse for something so full of itself.

We'll start with the good: 

Had the Pittsburgh Potato Pancake.  It was pretty good.  I wouldn't have known there was bacon on it had the menu not mentioned it, but pretty much everyone at the table enjoyed it (and there was enough that 8 guys were all able to have a bit of it).

The entrées were fantastic. Since I don't think cows are all that tasty, I had and enjoyed the crabcakes.  A good amount of crab, not too much breading at all.  The roasted corn ancho chile sauce was a great compliment to them.

Everyone else had steak and all loved it.  The only complaint was the coffee and cocoa crusted flat iron steak was incredibly small.  Temperatures ordered ranged from medium rare to medium well.  It looked to me like everything was cooked less than requested but no one was upset at doneness.  They looked delicious.  It's a joy to see a well cooked steak.  Made me wish i liked eating them.

The cotton candy after the meal.  Awesome.  Would have skipped the underwhelming dessert had I know it was coming.

The bad: We'd heard about how before ordering the meats were presented and explained.  We did not get this service, but did see it other tables getting it.

Our group's wine snob described the wine list as ""terrible.""  Nobody likes him though.  

Our waitress didn't seem to know what beers they had.  The draft selection was limited to Bud's finest.  When asked what they had in bottles she replied ""almost everything"" before shooting down several requests (Dogfish Head, Stella Artois, and Newcastle are a few I remember off the top of my head).

The guys that ordered the french onion soup thought it was delicious, but were upset that it was barely warm to the point it was hard to break through the cheese.

Dessert looked fantastic, but wasn't so good to eat.  The chocolate cake is incredibly rich, but merely ok.  The ""warmed"" apple tart came cold.

They apparently don't believe in serving coffee with dessert either, as it came out a good 15 minutes after (and they neglected to offer milk or sugar).

The whole thing comes down to the stupid card concept and the over complicating of meal ordering.  We go to Sweet Tomatoes\/Souplantation\/Souper Salad\/Fresh Choice BECAUSE IT'S A BUFFET!!!!!  The idea that I need some carry a card around to track what I eat is ludicrous!  Talk about over complicating things.

Ordered the build your own salad and barely filled the bowl.  Of course, only having like 6 leaves of romaine lettuce to get while there was a bucket of spinach didn't help the cause at all, but I digress.  That was one card swipe and it covered the salad, soup, desert and bread.  If I would have wanted to throw in a slice of pizza (which isn't there any more) that's another swipe; visit the rotisserie = another swipe.  Go to the drink island (WTF!) that was another swipe.  Point being is that if you're running a restaurant of any kind and can't track what's on a tray, then it's likely too complicated.  Just the idea of not being to go to a soda fountain and not have glasses waiting is mind boggling.

That said, the food was good, environment was nice, but way too uppity for what it is....A BUFFET!!!!  Whoever the MBA that came up with this idea should be flogged and just reset it to what was.  The price is certainly cheaper and while it's a one trip salad bar, you can load that mofo up and take home the extra.  But still...who wants to do that at....A BUFFET!  Oh...and another thing...why church up all the salad dressings?  Is it too hard to just have Italian?  Yep.  Gotta have ""basalmic vinagrette,"" because Italian is too peasant-like or something.

I ordered the Killer Burrito. Beef, beans, guac, and sour cream. Possibly a bit of cheese. The tortillas are made fresh from scratch, and taste amazing. Their beef tastes exactly like it would from someone's home. The salsa was nothing to get excited over, but the fresh, hot chips were great.

So you're probably wondering why I gave this two stars?

The prices are a joke! If you don't believe me, laugh at this:


Any plain burrito (carne asada, chicken, etc.) is $6, but if you don't like yours plain, it'll cost ya.

The horchata costs $2.75, and it's the fountain drink horchata, NOT the real stuff.

A quesadilla with carne asada, sour cream, and guac comes out to $11.00. Yeah, I made that face, too.

My burrito was $7.50. 

No, portions are NOT huge, they're the same as every other place. So in reality you're paying up to *double* the price for your meal (just think of that quesadilla!), and you're certainly not getting the quality to match. But does Mesa really have an alternative?",13,7,6,0,0,1,1

We went with the turkey chili, and it was RIDICULOUSLY tasty - lots of hearty filling with BAMF heat.

It's a shame because, with a little effort by those who run Cleveland Plays, this could be a great, stress-free tool for everyone in Cleveland. Sadly, it's mostly an unorganized mess. 

Generally, the schedules and scores are updated very, very late. Currently, our league page has not been updated for the last three weeks of games\/scores. While this isn't a big problem, it would be nice to have an up-to-date standings page during the season. This would take minimal effort from the staff to keep this updated. 

There are some weeks they don't bother entering results. You'll have full sessions go by with missing scores. It takes a few seconds, but apparently our money\/fees don't cover entering all of the scores. 

The referees also are wildly inconsistent, at least when it comes to indoor volleyball. It's frustrating for one referee to call nearly zero penalties the entire season, then for that same referee to call over a dozen per game later in the season. I looked over once and the same referee was watching the Indians game instead of our game, and, often asks the players to make a call because he wasn't paying close enough attention. Each team is required to pay $10 to the referee each game, so they make $20 to watch and referee a game for 40 minutes. This is on top of the already high league fees each session. I can't fault all of the referees for this, because there are other referees that do a great job. (EDIT 12\/6\/16: Most current\/new referees seem to be doing a much better job in the last few sessions!)    

Their have also been instances in which schedules, which have been posted for weeks, were changed at the last minute with no direct notice to anyone on a team. There's also been instances in which they will schedule overlapping sessions - so, if you want to play a spring and summer session, be prepared to spend an entire night for a few weeks going to multiple games at different locations, because you'll have to jump between locations to get both games in (that's if they don't schedule your team to play at the same time at multiple locations). Fellow players have actually been able to reach a Cleveland Plays representative on the phone about a problem, were told they would get an immediate call back, but wouldn't get a call back. Generally, there isn't a response from the emails posted on their website, either. It's incredibly frustrating to have incorrectly reported scores or schedules that are posted and have to track down a staff member to get the information.   

Don't count on any communications for cancelations regarding outdoor events, either. They'll often announce games are canceled after the games were supposed to take place, if at all. They recently had an 'announcement' (which was just a comment they posted under their cover photo of their Facebook page) that all volleyball games were cancelled at 6:30 p.m., but the games started at 6 p.m. 

The website also constantly crashes\/isn't available. Any decent amount of traffic (such as though trying to check schedules because they're all updated last minute, or trying to see if a sport if cancelled for the evening) renders the site unavailable.

We came here specifically for the seafood, it's probably a hit or miss with it though. There are times when I found the crab meat to be super salty, not sure why but then the next day it was just fine so I don't know who it is that's adding the salt, but stop it! 

The rest of the food is alright, nothing too spectacular to note. They have a decent selection of dessert but I'll probably only stick to the gelato as the rest of it isn't THAT great at least to me. 

So really if you love seafood and don't want to venture down to the M for their weekend seafood buffet, then the one here is just as good! Might cost a bit more, but it's all the time so can't really complain and considering it's on the strip too? I think it came out to $27 per person with tax and maybe tip?

The hotel itself, the layout, and functionality? Absolutely hot garbage. In my opinion, this place is the epitome of trying to be too cool for school. First of all, there's no closets. Again, there are no closets - as in none. I simply don't understand this. Also, there is one drawer...in between the beds and could
maybe for two books. Zero closets, one drawer. 

The water pressure in the shower is the lightest thing I've ever felt. In fact, I couldn't feel it - it's non-existent. There were three hangers in the room hung on wooden sticks coming out from the wall. If I hung up half my clothes I block the tv. Just wasn't a comfortable or accommodating space.

The staff was great and caring, but whoever designed this place has not stayed there for more than 1 night. Either that or they didn't bring any clothes. I am grateful for the lack of functionality at The Moxy because it reminds me how much I appreciate functionality in a hotel.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0

Toppings bar is a bit limited, but they have almond roca which I specifically come for. I like that it is a local business and not a large chain. The only downside is whenever I've gone in there, the workers would be blaring music and then rush over to turn it off. Last time I went in it was a pretty explicit song. Like you can see us walking up to the store, why not turn it off ahead of time, or just play it in the back loud enough you can hear it, not loud enough for people outside to hear.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
