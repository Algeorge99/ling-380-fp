"Service was incredible! Food was simple but not that impressive.The only thing that I considered to be absolutley exceptional was the Watermelon and Feta Salad! Also Ordered the Chicken breast and Wagyu Skirt steak was ok. I only think it was because everything was cold for some reason (30 minute wait for main course), but other then that it was just ok. Would have rather went to Jean George or Mastro's for the Price; and will also consider that when the option arouses.",2,3,3,3
"Food was OK, but this is a smoky local hole in the wall. Service is a little bit rough but it's a place filled with no character other than the smoke stains on the wall.",2,3,4,4
"The food was decent, however, the wait for delivery was over an hour AND they forgot one of the 2 mains that we ordered. We called, the owner apologized and said he'd send over the food and a refund in about 25 minutes, which sounded great. Over 45 minutes later, the food still wasn't at our house and when we called to ask, the owner said that the money and not the food was on the way over, and that we had never asked for another order, and was extremely rude. Never ordering from here again.",1,1,1,1
"I wanted to grab something quick while we waited to board our flight home to California and this was the only place that looked decent in our terminal. The seating area was packed with people and their luggage but I table opened up and we snagged it. I got in line to get our food and was handed a menu. There were a lot of options but it was mainly different combinations of the same thing. I ended up ordered a BLT, which took forever to make. and a breakfast burrito, which was the quickest. If Peets was closer to us (we were dead tired from Spring Training) then I would have just gone there and spent less money for better coffee and breakfast. 
 
 The BLT had a lot of avocado and bacon on it but it was not worth $9+ and the breakfast burrito, from what my boyfriend said, was okay. 
 
 I don't think I'd go back to this place unless it was the only option.",2,2,3,3
Worst service ever. Food is really good but waiters don't know what they are doing and it's impossible to order pick up. It becomes more of a hassle to eat there rather than just being able to enjoy it,1,2,2,1
"Great service-they were busy but I walked in and didn't have to wait. Nail tech paid meticulous care and attention to trimming my cuticles-which I believe to be the most important part of a manicure. Good prices, nothing fancy inside but decent selection of colors and brands.",5,5,5,5
" The FOOD was good, I ordered the Cajun chicken pasta. They have good music & lemonade. The staffs nice.
 
 - I found a hair on one of the noodles. GROSS. The wait is ridiculously long, like 30-40 or MORE! The waitress kept messing up our order & receipt. She takes forever to give you your check. ",2,2,2,2
"Nice server, but VERY slow! Didn't get our food until an hour after... Also make sure you check your bill, they upcharged a few dollars on each entrees.. Most likely will not return.",2,1,2,1
"Mac's had a 5 star review from me, but they changed the tried and true ""Huy Fong Foods"" brand sriracha hot sauce to ""Roland's"" brand sriracha hot sauce which is literally inedible. Very disappointing.",2,3,2,2
"Dinner has always been excellent so no complaints. But went for brunch a few weeks ago & definitely complainable. Very weird brunch items. There were 5 of us & none of us wanted anything on the menu. We all ended up getting the kids menu with regular eggs, hash browns & toast. Took 1.5 hours!!!!! to get our food. It was seriously unbelievable. Service was awful. Awful. Awful. I'll stick to dining for dinner only from now on.",3,5,2,1
"Well, it started off good but quickly went down hill!!! I bought a Groupon which clearly stated that if you purchased the groupon for $15 , then you would get $30 worth of food and drink. The Groupon said 50% off. Well, when the bill came, the waitress said, you have to spend $30 and then they would take $15 dollars off. I talked to the manager because, to me this was false advertisement!! Initially he agreed with the waitress, saying that the owners didn't mean to print that. I stood firm in my argument because I knew he was wrong. I've purchased other groupons and they do not require you to spend 30 bucks in order to get discounted what you paid upfront. This was bullshit and I politely let them know! The food was just average, and our waitress was rude after I told her that we still left her a20% tip despite the mix up!! I will not be going back!!!",1,1,1,1
"Was a big fan until yesterday. Hot sauce used to be the best, now just tasted like tomato sauce. Food was awful, they're only excuse was that they are training new chefs. Sadly, we will not go back.",1,1,2,2
"I finally stopped here with my Yelp bestie Heather S. before I left town going to the land down under... I have passed by this joint a kazillion times. I had not even realized the name change until we were walking up to enter! Wow they are super friendly, and I thought the lead cashier, maybe shift leader who helped us place our order was yummy! 
 
 I decided on the fried strips and mac and cheese, and Heather S. got the grilled chicken strips with mac and cheese.
 
 The food is fresh and good. Really how can you go wrong with breading chicken and frying it, they do seem to make it just that much more delicious. I love the fried strips, the panko breading was fried to a perfect golden brown, mmmmm yum yes..
 
 My only thing is that I think they should give up the sauce more. That is a pet peeve of mine when a joint charges for or limits ""extra"" sauce. I mean they are called strip n dip chicken right? I ordered the 6 piece chicken strip meal and ran out of sauce with there limit of 3 small dipping sauce sides.
 
 Anyhow, it was good, I just did not get the happy ending I had been hoping for...
 
 This goes in my overrated file.... :(",3,1,3,4
"I sincerely hope last night was just an off night as I have been here twice before and had great experiences. Last night was not one of them. Three problems -1. the white bean and kale soup was thin and under-seasoned - very weak\/watery. It was a rather bland broth with a handful of beans and some chopped kale. I realize it may have been a vegetable broth but something was seriously lacking. 2. The bruschetta bread was not grilled or toasted - it was just the bread brushed with oil. 3. not that big of a deal but usually they have two or three entree choices - but tonight they only had one. I love the location, vibe, and staff - and the owners have been very nice and gracious in the past - they were not around last night that I could see. I just hope it was an off night. We had out of town guests with us and were in a hurry so we didn't say anything at the time and didn't have time to re-order. I would expect that would have graciously fixed things or refunded a portion. Please stay on top of your kitchen guys! I want to keep coming.",2,2,2,2
"This place is good, but it's really not THAT good when it comes to the food.
 I would say the food here is 100% overpriced. Plus, they already makes tons of money on alcohol sales, so they really should lower their food prices. Appearances on tv dont make the food taste better. 
 They finally opened up a family dinning section but it is closed a lot, so expect to leave when you arrive if you brought kids.",2,5,2,3
"I have never been disappointed. Food is home cooked, all entres are well portioned, and service is very good. It does not matter if you go to Dominics Pizza, JoJos Sports bar, or Dominics Italian Rest. you will be happy you went there. A life long customer.",5,5,5,5
I really wanted to like this place. I ordered the macadamia nut latte. The cup was filled a little more than halfway. The server was very rude.,2,1,2,2
"Well, I wanted to like the place but let me say:service is great, staff is great, ambience is great, coffee is great. I just like to eat healthier and while they did sub egg whites and hold the hollandaise sauce and cheese, it was a little tasteless. They say, if you want Chinese food, go to a Chinese restaurant. If you want healthier fare, go to Good Egg\/First watch, or even JJ's or Einstein's where you can adjust the menu. Not many options here. BUT..I will say, for people who want a hearty breakfast, it's tops. Just not for me.",2,2,4,4
"It's not my favorite sushi spot but it's very convenient down the street. I typically get a poke bowl. They are not like the ones I have got before but it fills me up for sure. Not a fan of the ceviche. Really big chunks of every ingredient and is only served with four tiny crostini's, which is clearly not enough. Very fresh tasting but not my cure for ceviche. Rolls are ok. Quantity of spicy salmon was great. Probably the best tasting thing I have had thus far. I have been here, 5 or 6 times. Hope better for next. I experiment each time.",3,5,4,4
I usually love this place but this time they didn't remind me that my sandwich didn't come warm and when the guy came to serve it I asked him if he could just toast the bread and he walked off service is something to be desired,3,5,2,1
Staff is nice. But hidden fees are a joke. They don't tell you all the costs until you get there and are signing the paperwork. $1 first month is actually $60....I would have chosen another place for storage if I would have had more time to research.,3,1,1,1
"I love this extremely over priced store lol. They have so much unique things. I love shopping for friends here. The staff is usually pretty cool. Only complaint when in tell them I'm just looking, they keep coming back if I'm sure. I'm sure",3,5,3,4
"Yet again my first time visiting another lunchtime chain store; and I was not impressed really. The food was only ""OK"" and a bit bland. Plenty sauces to choose from if you know what you're doing; but it would need a lot to cover the tasteless food. I had the ""'lil bowl"" and a drink and with a side of guacamole it came to $9.68?! Wow...not good value for $$ in any language! The staff are very friendly and service is fast (it was empty for the most part at 11:45) Their credit card reader was also down so it was harder on them than usual They could give you a little more taco meat on the meal also. Don't think I'll be going back....",2,2,3,2
"3 words...Twice Baked Potato! Oh my, these are so good!!! I love these so much I have even ordered them to go when we are grilling steaks at home. But it is always nice we we go there for dinner too. 
 
 The rest is good as well. I've had the filet, prime rib, various appetizers, a delicious orange martini. 
 
 Only once did I not enjoy my food. The one time I decided to order the peppercorn steak. Way too peppercorny. (is that a word? ;-)) It did live true to it's name but way too much. Couldn't taste anything else.
 
 So stick with the basics and definitely get the twice baked potato.",4,3,4,3
"I think my expectations were too high before I arrived. I love me some good eggs Benedict, and my friend had wanted to take me here to try the lobster. 
 
 I'm a bit picky, since good Benedict has to have amazingly good sauce. Once that sauce is instant made or out of a bag, it just doesn't taste right.
 
 I wasn't too fond of the sauce on my Benedictus. The banana muffin or bread thing was good. The interior was a bit run-down when I went.",3,2,3,2
They started off good but looks like cleanliness is not a big priority. Too bad because the few times we visited the service was good. It was so filthy I just threw our food away and went across the street. I don't understand how an employee can't just take the time to wipe the tables are mop the floor after someone dropped a drink.,2,1,2,2
Given that this restaurant has a prime location overlooking the forth and both the rail and road bridge we were very dissppointed by our visit. We visited at the latter end of the summer when it was busy but not mobbed. We went in to find a table for a drink with a view to eat. All the empty tables were dirty and no one made an effort to clear one for us. we stood about for a few minutes and as no one made any attempt to help we left and went elsewhere. This could be a fantastic place but needs a bit of a push.,2,3,1,1
"Good drinks, cool space. This was my first time there and it may have been an off night but it wasn't very crowded or lively. However the drinks are decent and the space is fun. LED sky curling and lots of tiki themed decor to keep your eyes entertained. The staff was very polite and attentive as well. Only bummer is they were out of signature mugs and that is a must for any tiki bar. I collect them and consider it part of the experience. 
  
  I'll try again next time I'm in town and hopefully I'll have better luck.",3,5,4,4
"not my favorite or even go to place 
  the food was nothing special 
  a bit over priced
  great location tho 
  the music physically was louder in the bathroom then in the resturant...not sure whats up with that",2,3,3,3
"I've eaten here twice and enjoyed it. I had previously heard that the service was rude but I never found them to be anything but nice. Food was great. Don't know if I'd call it THE BEST pizza I've ever had in my life, but it ranks in Top 10 for sure.",4,5,4,4
"So so. Definitely did not live up to the hype. Small portions and bland at best. I Wil say the rock shrimp app was fantastic though. The place is very tight and VERY loud. Service was average, definitely not anything exceptional. Place is very over priced for the portions and flavors.",2,3,3,2
"Not sure what all the hype on this place is about... The ambiance is decent, I'll give them that. But the food was not good at all. Maybe we just got the wrong things? When I asked for recommendations from our server she gave us short, uneducated answers and had a bit of an attitude. Chicken fingers were about the same quality as the frozen ones at the grocery store.. I asked for ranch to hide the taste a bit and waited ten minutes for someone (not even our server) to bring it. Only to find out later that we were charged for it! We also got a French dip with au jus. Both the sandwich and dip were WAAAYYY to salty to eat. Disgusting. 
  
  Atmosphere: 4\/5. Decent patio, new building. 
  
  Service: 1\/5. Server did the bare minimum. Also should have warned us that they charge for ranch\/extra sauce.. I've always been warned by servers at places that do that. 
  
  Food: 1\/5. Chicken strips were edible but barely, French dip was beyond disgusting. 
  
  I might go again to try the burgers that everyone loves so much and give the place another shot, given that it's so close to my place, but my first experience was not good at all.",2,2,2,2
"We have been here several times for Sunday Supper, but went last Friday night with another couple. The food was good, not great, but good. I think it is overpriced. it was so loud we had to scream at each other. The worst was when we got home my husband mentioned how much it was and I have to assume we got charged for wine that we didn't have as the bill was about $60. more than it should have been. I'm going to give them the benefit of the doubt and assume it was an error, but will not go back for anything other than Sunday Supper and will carefully check the bill.",3,5,2,2
"The place has good wings, but only if you order them at the restaurant, they are far worse when you order takeout (I've ordered in both at the location and takeout more than once, so I feel this is consistent). All of the rest of the food is very average.",2,3,2,1
"During my first visit I probably would have given two or three stars. Nothing terrible happened but the service was pretty lackluster and the Mac and Cheese ""dinner"" was literally a giant bowl of decent (albeit standard) macaroni with creamy cheddar sauce.
  
  Having been back several times since that initial visit I have found that the service during my initial visit must have been an exception and that I simply need to order other items. I do love mac and cheese, but here it is better ordered as a side. I also appreciate that The Diner on Clifton is open late and serves part of their breakfast menu all day -- which is a big plus for a breakfast for lunch or dinner guy like me. I am also a fan of their shakes and will certainly continue visiting, especially if I have a need for a late night snack in the area.",4,5,3,3
"Cute space and decor - this place has potential. 
  
  The only reason I am giving this place a low rating because the food was not very good. I ordered the Shrimp Po-Boy, it came out cold and the complete opposite of what a Shrimp Po-Boy should taste like. The shrimp was small and cold, the sandwich basically tasted like a salad in a stiff baguette. I was so disappointed, I wanted to cry because I was looking forward to fried shrimp in a warm baguette. For $11 I would expected something amazing.
  
  Definitely not coming here again :(",2,2,2,2
"Definitely not cheap. Food's good quality though.
  
  Had:
  Squid tentacles - Ordered because Yelp said they were good. They were pretty good, but the larger pieces were a little bit chewy. Good flavor though.
  Curry cuttlefish - Cuttlefish were really tender. Curry flavor was good. Awkward how they put fries into the bottom though. Steamed cuttlefish = steamed fries. Defeats the purpose of fries. Also filler. Less cuttlefish if you put fries at the bottom of the dish.
  Spareribs with black bean sauce - Definitely better quality ribs than I'm used to at dim sum. Other than that, pretty similar. Taro chunks at the bottom. Also filler.
  Fois gras and mango deep fried rolls - Think standard shrimp salad rolls at dim sum, but with small bits of fois gras and strips of mango inside, and the salad dressing on of the roll. Five pieces? Something like that. Not enough fois gras. Salad dressing overwhelmed the entire thing. That being said, it was tasty. Not worth the price though.
  Snow pea shoot and fried tofu steamed rice noodle - for all you vegetarians out there, this one's delicious. It's an interesting combination, and the mouth feel is quite nice. Snow peas are fresh.
  Snow pea shoot steamed dumpling - Supposedly had scallop in it. I couldn't find any. That being said, the snow pea shoot filling was almost (or actually) entirely just that. It was really tasty.
  Lion head beef meatballs - Or just big beef meatballs. A tad more black pepper in these than I was expecting, but it was quite welcome. Meat was tender. Very much so. Not much beef flavor though.
  Deep fried taro shred with minced pork filling - Usually yum. This one was also yum. Taro shred was nice and loose (not dense and packed in. More like deep fried floss?) and the inside was moist. Good ratio of external taro and internal filling.
  Garoupa and bitter melon pan fried rice noodles? - I think that was the name of the fish...Fish was delicious. Bitter melon was a good kind of bitter. Pan fried rice noodles were done well. Good base. Sauce made it so it wasn't dry. Good portion for six people.
  Durian pastry - An odd green color. That being said, the inside is quite strong on the durian, and entirely delicious. Custard-like. The outside was flaky pastry and oh so delicious as well. Three pieces. A great way to end my meal.
  
  If the prices were better and the service was better, I'd make this one of my go-to dim sum places. Well, that and if it was closer to home...",3,3,3,4
"TIME is what you need when you come here. But it's worth it. Some may say the service brings new meaning to Lazy Mexicans -- but they are really just taking the time to make everything fresh! From the guacamole to the margarita, it's all done right before your eyes and it's worth the wait. The Tacos are good, and reasonably priced too. Just make sure you're not in a rush.",4,5,5,5
"Overall, not a bad dining experience... but nothing was exemplary about it either. I'll go back.
  
  I am fairly consistent with what I order when trying new places that are similar to other places that I have previously been to. What I mean by that is that unless something is highly recommended by other Yelpers, then I will typically get the steak tacos at a Mexican restaurant... and that way I can, in my own way, compare each restaurant to the others.
  
  Anyway, there was only a very brief wait to get seated... and the service was really attentive, coming back to check on our meal, and filling up our waters often (always a big plus in my book).",3,3,3,3
"Food was only ok, not amazing!! Prices are decent. The latte was great!! 
  
  The wait was way too long....waited 40 minutes for the table for 2 and another 35 minutes for the food. This restaurant is very small, that is why the wait was long. The menu is small and few items, such as the popular dishes like Egyptian falafel and Grilled Cheese, were sold out by noon. After a 40 minutes wait to find out that the popular dishes were sold out...that was a big disappointment. I wondered why the waitress didn't tell us about this when she gave us the menu and only mentioned about the items are sold out when we place the ordered !! 
  After all, the Service was great..friendly staffs.
  
  In conclusion, i will not come back to this restaurant again. DEFINITELY NOT WORTH THE WAIT AS FOOD WAS NOT THAT GREAT!! NOTHING SPECIAL.",2,1,3,2
"What a great place! My dining partner and I were both charmed by the ambiance, and we each took full advantage of their 2 oz. taster wines--it's such a great way to have a different wine with each course and still be able to go to work the next day.
  
  The food wasn't that impressive, though--I ordered a pasta dish that arrived oily and underseasoned, and my friend's chicken was similarly bland. We were very impressed with the post-prandial cheese selection, though, and the appetizer we shared was a lovely balance of salty (anchovies), sour (capers), and sweet (buffalo mozzarella). I'm glad there's a place like this in the neighbourhood, but I think I'll stick to drinks and appetizers here.",3,3,3,4
This review is for Road Kill Grill... The ribs were tasty enough but very dry & overcooked as was the brisket. The mac & cheese was forgettable just like the potato salad. The spicy BBQ sauce was the best part about the meal. I also do not like how you have to wait in the same damn room that they sell the butcher meat in which is already an extremely small place & the door is constantly bumping someone in the ass. This place is WAY OVERRATED. I have eaten from their truck before & for some reason it was better. The sad thing is that since that Guy Fieri said it was good on his Drive-Ins & Dives show every sheep in Las Vegas can't think with their own tastebuds... either that or BBQ has some really slim pickins in Sin City.,2,2,2,4
The food was tolerable..friendly staff also. They delivered within 45 minutes as was told. Taste for pricing: I wasn't too pleased. For a 24 hour delivery I wouldn't expect too much more than what I did. One negative thing is that I specified wanting sweet and sour and teriyaki sauce and they forgot but that wasn't a deal breaker I just wasn't crazy for the taste. Paid about 40 dollars for two combo plates.,2,3,3,3
"Came here last night with my boyfriend and I have to say if I were basing my rating on the service alone it would be 5 stars. 
  
  We started with the calamari, baked clams, and meatballs. The meatballs were absolutely amazing! They were soft, moist, tender and very flavorful. The calamari was a little too greasy for me but again the sauce was seasoned perfectly. The baked clams were mostly breading and didn't have that crispness on top that you look for. 
  
  We then split the Caesar salad which was very good and had nice sheets on thin fresh Parmesan cheese. 
  
  For entrees I had the Ossobuco which I was disappointed with. It was a little tough and the risotto was bland. My boyfriend had the chicken Parmesan which he enjoyed. 
  
  For dessert the peanut butter tart was delicious! 
  
  All in all not a bad meal, but nothing compared to the original back in Harlem.",3,3,4,4
"Showed up one evening for food to go and there wasn't a single employee in the building. One finally came from the patio and took my order. I asked for extra tzatziki sauce for my gyro. I was given my food and checked to make sure my extra sauce made it in, there was no sauce at all. Again no employee anywhere... So I went into the kitchen and asked the chef for sauce to go. 
  
  Food was ok. Service was horrible.",1,1,2,1
"Crust, crust,crust was a bust.thin yes but no crunch to it. The cheese , sausage and sauce was very tastey. Had a antipasta salad..just ok at best.. If you are looking for a crispy crust not here..",3,3,3,2
"Showed up early for our romantic anniversary dinner reservation on October 9th, expecting to have a cocktail to find the bar was packed. That's fine, we went next door to Hecho. Upon our return, we were seated at a tiny table for two, in the packed bar! When asked, ""Is there something more private for us? This is rather uncomfortable,"" the host responded with, ""Well, since you made your reservation today, this is what we have for you."" Ok, that's fine, we'll relax and make the best of it. A server quickly came by, asking for our order yet, we hadn't opened the wine list nor reviewed the menu yet. After deciding what we'd like to order, about 10mins later, we waited patiently for our server who never showed after another 15mins so we left. We walked over to L'Atelier thinking we had no chance of getting a seat yet alas, we were seated and had another FABULOUS evening! Thank You and we'll be back to support the Joel Robuchon again in a heartbeat. Sorry Tom Colicchio. Cheers!",1,5,2,1
"This place was surprisingly bad. The place looks really nice. From the outside you expect this place to have good food. The menu should have been the first hint. Not a lot of options, and even still, not a lot of good options. 
  
  I ordered the grilled cheese and tomato bisque. It took 20 minutes to make. Plane white bread with little cheese in the center. The bisque tasted watered down. Overall it was very bland. Trust me, you will get better food from the place further down the terminal.",2,3,3,2
Visited for breakfast. Krysina A. was full of energy and extremely interactive. A plus when servers r usually robotic and task oriented. Loved her personality. Coffee was good and hot. Hash browns crispy. Bacon crispy. We ordered at the table.,4,4,4,4
"I wanted to love this place, but didn't. I chose this place based on the online reviews, it did not live up to them at all. Perhaps the food here use to be good, and the cook lost her passion -I don't know, but I've had good Czech and Eastern European food and this was not it. 
  
  Having recently moved back to Ohio from San Francisco I was looking for a place like I use to go to in SF with my Czech Friend Martina called ""Frankies Bohemian Café"". http:\/\/frankiesbohemian.com\/. The owner came from the same town as my friend so whenever we went, we got the hook up-all kinds of wonderful Czech food not on the menu but made for ""family"". I've been missing it something fierce, now so looked online for something here in Cleveland.
  
  I came across Marta's and it had great reviews on a number of websites. I was looking forward to eating some really good\/stick to your ribs food. Unfortunately this place did not live up to any of the reviews. 
  
  The décor was totally vintage 60s and kind of charming. It had an European tavern feel with tables on one side and a long bar running the length of one side.The owner\/cook\/waitress was very pleasant but sadly that was the best part of the meal.
  
  We got there at 6 on a Friday evening and the place was completely empty. Having been open since 4pm and completely empty on a Friday night at 6pm isn't a good sign for any restaurant. We wanted pierogies for appetizer and were told they were out of the pierogies (potato\/cheese) we wanted. Strike 2-another bad sign for a business that clearly wasn't busy and running out of food. So we ordered the other filings and our entrees. 
  
  Anxiously awaiting our food, hubby got a Czech beer (on tap). Plus for having a good European beer! Then we got our food and it was mediocre at best-a total letdown. The plate was piled high with food, covered in pale looking gravies-not very appetizing. I got the Chicken paprikash and it was tasteless and bland. I don't know what the other reviewers got who raved about it but there was nothing to rave about with mine. The sauce was very runny, pale and bland. The spaetzel was good though. Hubby got Pork Wienerschnitzel-said it was tough, WAY too much breading and a greasy gravy. We couldn't finish it and declined any dessert. 
  
  Not only was it so-so, it was pricey. One appetizer, two entrees, one beer ($7.50 for tap beer!) and one Sprite came out to $42 before tip. YIKES! Not cheap and not worth the money. . If you want good Czech food, this is not the place to go. I will continue my search for GOOD Eastern European food.",2,3,2,2
"The dim sum here was pretty bad. But the service was surprisingly good. Dim sum houses are not normally known for their friendly waitstaff, but one of the push cart ladies here was quite attentive and promptly brought me things (chang fen, Chinese broccoli) when I asked.",2,3,3,3
"For some reason, the tortellini was completely without flavour. This resto has long been a favourite of ours so we were stunned by the abject quality of what should be an effortless dish for an Italian restaurant. 
  
  We went in March, and our last visit was two years before that...so maybe something's changed. Please don't make it difficult for us to recommend you, Eduardo!",2,5,2,1
"5 stars for the food..... about 2 for the service. On a Saturday afternoon during a Pens game there was 1 worker. The place was buzzing and the bar was full. I'm not shaming them for being busier than expected, but how servers handle busy times is important. A simple, ""Hi, I will be with you in just a second"" could have gone light years in the situation, but instead we were blatantly ignored and sitting at a dirty table for 15 minutes and finally approached without so much as a ""Hello"". I had to ask, after someone from the back cleared the previous guests' drinks and check, for the table to be wiped down.
  
  I ordered the cobb salad with smoked chicken and my mom ordered the pulled pork quesadillas. Both were very generous portions and tasted delicious. The menu here is extremely impressive and I don't doubt most everything else tastes as delicious as the food we had on Saturday. 
  
  It's a really cool industrial - barnyard décor and I think this restaurant would do great in Lawrenceville or Bloomfield if they cleaned up their service a little bit and had more people staffed for the Saturday lunch hour. This is off the beaten path with (from what I know) little signage. Probably hard to come across if you don't already know where to look. I don't get out this way very often but is definitely a place I would like to bring Bobby back to try. I'd be happy to give them another shot..but this particular experience left me wanting more in regards to service at at a restaurant. So, just A-OK for now.",3,3,3,3
"The food was good, slightly above average. I Ordered the steak and eggs and pancakes. The pancakes were slightly below I hop quality. I think they offer vegan and vegetarian food as well. Service was adequate but not over the top. I'd go back if I was in the area.",3,3,3,4
"The only reason this isn't a 5 star rating is because of the crappy customer service I ALWAYS get here. I love dunkin coffee so I come here every other morning for some. However when my order is wrong, I'm treated with disrespect. No one takes accountability here! Not even the manager in the mornings! I'm sick of the mistreatment",2,1,1,1
"Extremely frustrated, we like to go and enjoy their Happy Hour food but got turned away tonight because we had our grandchildren with us!!!!!! They told us Happy Hour is only for upstairs and you can't go upstairs with children. Last time we went with our grandchildren they honored Happy Hour downstairs due to having the kids...WE WILL NOT BE GOING BACK.",1,1,1,1
"The Tron pub used to be a lovely bar when it was known as the Tron Ceilidh house, but since being taken over by the it's a scream chain it's gone a bit down hill.
  
  
  Decorated in garish primary colours, this place is primarily a student haunt. If you're a student you can buy a yellow card at the bar which gives you discounted drink prices, but even without it's fairly cheap. There's a tatty pool table, juke box and other machines, along with huge tv screens that seem to show every type of sport imaginable.
  
  
  The food is actually pretty good. Although it's mainly pub grub and stodge, it's cheap, there's plenty of it and it's great for a hangover. The Scream burger in particular is pretty fantastic.
  
  
  A decent enough place to pop into for a spot of lunch, but avoid on student nights or when there's a big sporting event on",3,3,4,4
"This place has received plenty of positive reviews on YELP. I am not sure why. 
  I only came here for lunch because Ko-Mex was closed yesterday. From the outside, the place looks sketchy. However, I was pleasantly surprised at the clean and inviting dining area once we walked in the door. 
  
  For lunch, I chose the Moco-Loco which was layered with steamed rice, a hamburger patty, a fried egg, and brown gravy. I asked for my egg scrambled, not fried. Oh well - I ate it anyways. The dish was good--not great. 
  
  My wife tried the Korean noodle dish-Japchae. We didn't like the texture of the noodles they used for this dish. Imagine the texture of gummi bears while eating noodles. Because they were so spongy, no flavor stuck to them. Who wants to eat plain spongy noodles? Not this guy....
  
  My parents were with us since they were visiting from the Bay Area. They both chose the bibimbap (spelling?) which was a bowl of rice, vegetables, beef, an egg, and spices. The beef inside these bowls was bland, tough, and fatty. Oh, and the side of macaroni salad was way too salty.
  
  The service was spotty. For example, I didn't like that our entrees were coming out one at a time -every 5 minutes. Plus, I was not offered a drink refill at all during lunch. The more I write this review, the more I realize I don't really like anything about this place.",2,2,2,2
"Ambience. Thumbs Up.
  
  Cocktails and Wine. Double Thumbs Up.
  
  Food? Overpriced Mediocrity. 
  
  I had Ribeye and Escargot. While the escargot was forgettable, I'm a steak man. 
  
  American Diner Steak? Excellent. Just make sure to throw an egg on it to add some taste.
  
  Pocket Burning Steak? Double Excellent. I love the monthly piece that lets me indulge in my carnivorous pleasures. 
  
  This was a pocket burning diner steak. $65, hacksaw rough, slightly overcooked, and literally 1\/3 fat. Not in between or around the edges fat, but literally an entire piece of the cut. Screw that mess.",2,2,3,3
"Amazing live music...they even managed to squeeze me in without reservation letting me know they would need my table after 9PM. i liked the hostess honesty. Great group of ladies.
  
  Unfortunately same cannot be said for server or food here necessarily. I was feeling a tender steak and made a point to ask the server which of their Bavette or strip loin is most tender. He told me the strip loin...so I trusted him. The person next to me was having steak frites...his looked perfectly cooked medium rare. I got my steak. Well done to hell. I told my server and he looked at my well done cross section and said ""yes you mentioned medium rare..."" Mind blowing stupidity. I said its over cooked and not medium rare....he says in Canada it's medium rare...I said if this is medium rare...what the hell is well done? Charred to shit?
  
  Anyways he claimed I should have ordered it blue and brought me a newer steak. It was better but not medium rare. More like medium. Steak was delicious but the vegetables were so\/so.
  
  I'd recommend the place for live music and OK food. Not great for perfect steaks. Prices reasonable but the food I would sort of say is below par.",2,2,3,2
"Fantastic food! However, we were there for two and a half hours and only got two drinks from our waitress... with the cost of the food and the upscale type of restaurant it's suppose to be, I thought the service would have been better...",4,2,2,2
"Was excited to try this place, but ended up pretty disappointed. Echoing what others have said, the beers do taste very watered down, so much so that we had a sip of each and that's it. Food wasn't memorable either, and 3\/4 of it came out lukewarm\/cool. The fish in the fried fish and tots was soggy and room temp. Overall, flavors weren't very good or special enough to warrant a return. It's also quite loud, I was really having to raise my voice to be heard by my dinner partner. It's a nice looking place for sure though.",2,3,2,2
"Service was good. The server was very professional and courteous. The restaurant just got slammed - high school grad ceremony across the street just got out. It's Kelsey's so you expect pub grub. Four of the five meals we ordered were good. Sadly, I ordered a steak. Chipotle shrimp sirloin. Don't order the steak!! Omg. Worst cut of sirloin ever. I mean ever. You know the tongue of an old pair of leather dress shoes that have been worn for years and years? It would have better texture than the cut I had. Gross. And naturally, the frozen veggies boiled to ""almost thawed"" were a nice touch. 
  At any rate, good spot for pub grub and a pint. Typical for chain restaurants I would think. I won't order big there again, but I'd order the fish and chips or the Mac and cheese. Oh, and don't ask for a special request...it will be forgotten...could have been due to the slam, or order entry done wrong....meh...",3,2,3,3
"I never though that I could not enjoy a big bunk of lobster. But I guess it's possible. This place was just really pretentious without anything to back it up. Granted, we were a big group of 20-somethings but the place was pretty empty so I don't think a bad attitude was warranted. 
  
  I think the theme of the night was quantity over quality. The shellfish platter was full of giant pieces of seafood that tasted like it came out of a freezer\/buffet line. The lobster was really rubbery and flavorless, but it was cute that they de-shelled it in front of you. Perhaps I should have gotten steak at a steakhouse (who knew?) The creamed spinach and mashed potatoes were good, but nothing memorable. The creme brulee was really good (isn't it always) and the chocolate volvano souffle was also good. 
  
  But i don't think anything would compel me to come back here. Even the deco is stuffy and pretentious. Boys, come here in a suit.",3,3,3,3
"i had:
  
  tomato bread, sliders, fries, babyback ribs, and ham&cheese croquette!
  
  they were amazing! gave me instant coma though,
  fast and attentive service too!",4,5,5,5
"First to the good points: the atmosphere and the service were good. 
  Now, to the OK points: the music choices were OK but way too loud.
  But to the main point: while the food is creative and tasty, in no way is this a restaurant for dinner. Each dish\/portion is the size of a tapas plate, but priced at a full entree\/mains level. This is precious, self-indulgent food, all about showing off the executive chef's culinary whims and not at all about serving a clientele with any appetite.
  Perhaps we might not have minded had we been on an expense account, or had drunk so much that we no longer noticed, but we left feeling we had been taken advantage of. This restaurant is all about the chef, and not about the diner. We didn't patronize it to be trendy, we went there to eat. And not at such an expensive price point.
  And as someone who's lived and eaten all over the US, I sure didn't recognize any of the Southern US cuisines supposedly riffed upon here....",1,2,3,3
"All food here is amazing! My favorite is the ""evil jingle"". I get it extra spicy. This means I will have exiting issues later, but it is totally worth it.. The staff here are very nice and on top of things. I love their accent. Love the environment here. Best Thai I have ever had!",5,5,5,5
"Caveat: I'm not a huge fan of Irish pubs. Irish pub food is generally uninteresting to me, and the food usually looks like dull glop on a plate. Not so at Piper's Pub. I went for Sunday brunch ~2pm, and the place wasn't at most half full. They have a great beer selection with a rotating list of good micros, & a special Sunday menu. 
  
  We went for Scotch eggs & the Smoked Salmon Boxty. The eggs took some time but my guess is that they were prepared fresh. They were good...but I wasn't blown away. Nothing against Pipers, I just don't think they're my style. Interesting though. 
  
  The Salmon Boxty...it was amazing. When I go back, I'll likely get the same thing...unlike me, but too delicious to pass up. It's more than filling so don't order anything besides an appetizer, or you'll feel like a fat kid. Think of it as a potato\/egg omelette...or just look it up on wikipedia for better description. Seriously though, get it. Your life may be changed forever.
  
  Also make sure to follow them on Twitter; they always announce their daily specials & newest beers on tap.",5,5,3,4
"First the burger WAS GREAT! Can't argue that. But after all it is a $15 burger, it had better be, lol. The reason for the 3 star rating was the way they pile up extra charges without letting you know. After my kids ordered their plain ole hamburgers the witness asked if they wanted mushroom or bacon. They, being kids said, ""ok"".......They don't tell you that that added $16 to the bill by doing that. Actually they way she mentioned it I too assumed it was part of the meal, she never said that it was extra, but then again I live in Vegas and know how they underhandedly gouge visitors. Shameful. Gordon, you don't need the money that bad.",3,1,1,1
"I have NO business going to a French restaurant. I request everything sans beurre, sans frommage, sans lait, since my curse developed in later-life is to be unable to tolerate dairy (thank goodness it struck after an indulgent honeymoon eating through France.) However, my dear friend wanted to enjoy a French meal, so we wondered into Bardot Brasserie. First, I must say that the service was SUPERB, and to me, service is a make or break aspect to a meal. The waiter and wine attendant were both fun, knowledgable, informative, and just lovely. Although the chef had every right to be un petit perturbed with a no-butter diner, he and the waiter conferred to decide what could be best modified for me, after I preemptively declined the salad nicoise. Chacuterie plate with bread--yum! Blue crab buckwheat crepe sans butter--good, not great-- although I did sneak a pinch of sauce on top. Beet salad with arugula so good-fresh and nutty arugula with hazelnuts to accent the nutty flavor, went perfectly with the goat cheese (I had to have a bite of the cheese). My friend was practically cooing with pleasure from her escargot wrapped in pastry; she said it was smooth and buttery goodness. The suggested wine was a pleasant surprise. I'm not a white gal (well, white wine, that is), but completely enjoyed the nectar-y German Kabinett. Finishing sorbets--orange and mango--so fresh and clean and more fruit-filled than just icy. Great espresso. Overall, a wonderful, indulgent lunch and I look forward to going back soon. SO, if this dairy-free gal can enjoy it so much, I imagine how good it is for those who are unencumbered. 5 stars for my enjoyment at Bardot Brassiere. And, I never would have known it was the 3rd day open--kudos to Bardot Brasserie!",5,5,4,5
"So this was my second time coming to dine in, but I've bought bagels from them multiple times. They advertise a breakfast deal for 4.95$ comprised of 2 eggs any style, a bagel or toast and a small coffee or tea. The first time I came here, I ordered just that and it was fine.
  
  Today, I decided to try out their omelette. I ordered the omelette with onions and cheddar cheese, roasted potatoes for an additional 0.50$ (have the option of a salad or sweet potatoes), a bagel and a tea to go. It all came to about 14$. Everything smelled really great and I was really looking forward to having a nice and filling breakfast. 
  
  As usual, their bagel was delicious - I have nothing to say about that. However, when it came to the eggs and roasted potatoes, there was waaaaaay too much oil. My mom tried one piece of the potatoes and wouldn't finish it, since she found it too oily. I was really hungry and ate about half of the omelette and the potatoes. Boy do I regret that. I don't think I tasted much of the cheese, but there was a hefty amount of onions (which I appreciate). Right before writing this review I had to take some tums. In retrospect, I should have probably either stuck to their plain eggs or ordered an egg white omelette (big maybe though). Either way, I would never order the potatoes again. 
  
  I will most definitely come back for their bagels, as they are absolutely delicious. But, I would order their omelettes with caution or not at all.
  
  ----------------------------------
  This is an update review..
  
  I have to say that their bagels are indeed delicious. I come back almost on a weekly basis to get bagels or their sandwiches (cravings!!). Their borekas are also yummy, whenever they have any left.
  
  I still don't think that I would order their omelettes anytime soon, but I'm definitely a returning customer for some of their other products. Their customer services is also very good, as they always welcome me with a smile and are very kind to their customers.",4,2,4,4
"um. not great. i ordered the chicken lo mein and the crab puffs - and well, was a bit bored. the decor is shady. and to be perfectly honest, if i'm going to eat chinese it should taste good - greasy and with a ridiculous calorie count but good.",3,3,3,4
"This place used to be great. Its gone kinda down hill. Maybe I would have given it a four star but the disappointment of how good it used to be takes another star :). The food is no so so where it used to be so flavorful. The service has gone down to, it used to be young energetic waitresses. Now they look like retired hooker that don't want to be bothered.",3,2,2,1
"Went here during lunch with a few coworkers. Place was very quiet at 12:30PM on a weekday. No need to wait. Solid service. Nice clean environment. 
  
  Now the food. The Funions are really good. Get um to share. Now for the mac and cheese. You get a lot of saucy cheese, topped with more stretchy cheese. I got the drunken cowboy, which had 3 slices of beef brisket with BBQ sauce. I'd recommend something with a tangy sauce like the BBQ to balance out the richness of the cheese, cause there's A LOT of cheese. It was nice to have something cut that grease coating in your mouth after each cheesy bite. I personally would like the cheese to be a touch saltier. The pasta was a little on the overcooked side. It was quite pricey for what you're getting IMO. Granted, it's definitely a heavy meal and you will leave full as hell and ready for an afternoon nap.",3,3,3,3
Very disappointed. The restaurant is beautifully decorated and relaxing. Nice looking bar and enough tables to be cozy but not crowded. But the service was on the slow to absent side. The food was mediocre. The sides were good but the entree itself was lacking for both my companion and me. Boring fish and dry burger. They were willing to make swaps and substitutions on the menu which was nice. I had a nice glass of wine--I'm glad I didn't want another because it was never offered. I wanted this to be a great little restaurant in the area and I'm disappointed it's not.,2,2,2,2
"Opted for African Palace because Nazareth was good. Great little spot. Service was a little on the slow side but rightfully so as there was only a single waitress for an otherwise full house.
  
  Admittedly, I haven't had too much Ethiopian food. I had the meat platter and the flavours were great, particularly the goat. I could eat a whole plate of the goat, actually. Great for a vegetarian. The spreads aren't overly saucy so they won't completely sog the already spongy injera. It's also relatively cheap. $20 for 2? Why not.
  
  I'd return when the craving strikes again.",3,3,4,4
Good location! The food is okay. The servers are great and helpful. Ordered chicken noodle soup. It came with a small bowl.,4,5,3,3
Had the special with chicken and the chicken was very low quality. The sause was nothing too special either. Had it for dinner and it tasted like it was there all day.,2,3,2,2
"The donuts are cheaper than Dunkin and taste way better. They also have a much larger selection of flavors (and they have cronuts). I ordered a mocha smoothie kinda thing and it tasted nothing like mocha. It tasted like an Olvatine shake; while it was good, it wasn't what I wanted. Today I stopped in and ordered an iced carmel coffee...big mistake. I swear I'm not exaggerating when I say it tasted like they swept up some dust\/dirt and made the coffee with that. It was gritty and really horrible. I didn't detect any caramel flavor, only that awful dirt taste. I had to throw it away :\/ waste of $4. 
 My advice: get some donuts but get your drinks elsewhere.",3,2,2,2
"I came in for the chin cool-sculpting service.The staff and service were all really friendly and inviting. During my initial first consultation, I was told that I was only a candidate for the front(centre) area of the chin, but not either of the sides of my chin. Instead i was offered a different procedure to target those areas. However, when I came in to get my actual procedure done, as the nurse (different from my consultation) was taking my measurements once again, she recommended that I get both of my left and right sides of the chin cool-sculpted as well, for maximum results. When I told her that I was seen as an inadequate candidate for this during my consultation, she seemed a bit confused, and told me that it would only make more sense to get the procedure done on my sides as well. I wish the accurate information was given to me in the initial consultation, as it would save me a second trip, and ultimately speed up my results. 
 Once again, whilst the service was nothing but friendly and inviting(10\/10), due to the inaccurate medical opinions and information I was provided, I will unfortunately, not be returning for any more services at the Bellair Clinic.",3,1,5,1
"I've been to JG numerous times over the past two years but last night the serving staff are WAY too pushy for the up sell. 
 
 Then the cameraman comes trying to push and sell photos. 
 
 What's next? Someone to sell me watches or a timeshare? 
 
 Enough.
 
 This is an expensive fine dining restaurant and I expect a little more professionalism for the service like it used to be. 
 
 It's steadily degenerated into a vegas hustle joint that I would be embarrassed to have a business dinner there.
 
 Food was great as normal.",1,4,1,1
"Meh. I guess if you were looking for a boba fix in Vegas, this is the best you are going to get. However I come from a land of the finest boba (rowland heights) so this is quite sub par boba.
 
 This place is pretty close to the strip and is in the heart of Chinatown in Las Vegas. The boba here is moderately priced, but good luck finding parking in this hellish parking lot. They just have your standard boba, but like everyone else, says if you are REALLY looking for a boba fix, go here. If not, save your money",3,5,2,2
"Two and a half stars, actually. Adequate food, excellent service, $15 slushies called ""margaritas"" that taste nothing like a margarita. An annoying fee they add to the bill that we had to Google, and it seems it's a fee they charge you just to eat at their restaurant. If you don't mind getting ripped off and you stick with beer, it's not a bad place.",3,3,2,2
"Ok, so i don't like writing negative reviews but here we go:
 Went Sunday for a birthday brunch about 12 people with kids, food is decent, the omelette guy is always pleasant and you can tell by his food he enjoys his job. Fruit was fresh.
 
 Waitstaff is a complete negative experience:
 took forever to get coffee, they brought 1 spoon with 4 coffees, i guess we re suppose to share, staff never checked up on us, we had to walk over and ask every time we wanted something, the place is inexpensive so i guess your getting what you pay for, decent food and lousy service.",2,3,2,1
"Great Italian food and fast service. I had jambalaya with chicken and shrimp. Very tasty and lots of flavors , they also gave us free breads with olive oil which is delicious. Firecrackers rolls are great .",3,5,4,4
"The two star ""I've experienced better"" rating is more than apt in this instance.
 
 The decor of Settebello is very nice and the ovens are cool to look at. It's really easy to get all jazzed about the wood fired oven and unique toppings and flavor combinations. Hell, the website does enough boasting about how original and special the restaurant is. But it all comes down to the food and this pizza just was not good.
 
 At the most basic level your margherita pizza should be the star. And it wasn't. The crust was flavorless and overcharred. Here's my unecessarily lengthy analogy: You know when you make grilled cheese (and c'mon, everyone makes 2 at a time, how could you eat just one?) and the first one comes out perfect but the second one comes out kinda messed up because the pan is probably too hot and there's not enough butter to help the bread brown correctly and the cheese doesn't fully melt because the thing is going to burn if you leave it on any longer? Well this is how my pizza was, it seemed hastily cooked over too high heat and lacked flavor. Not to mention the sauce was bland and the cheese was amorphous and too stringy. There was exactly one basil leaf on my pizza too and it was burnt to a crisp. All in all, a poor excuse for something so full of itself. Needless to say I was disappointed in a major way with this whole thing.",2,2,2,2
Nice boutique store for the products sold that ties in the show. If you like MJ this is a place to splurge on some items you might not have gotten before. Lots of cool shirts.,3,5,5,4
"Went with a party of 8 for my friends Bachelor Party. 
 
 We'll start with the good: 
 
 Had the Pittsburgh Potato Pancake. It was pretty good. I wouldn't have known there was bacon on it had the menu not mentioned it, but pretty much everyone at the table enjoyed it (and there was enough that 8 guys were all able to have a bit of it).
 
 The entrées were fantastic. Since I don't think cows are all that tasty, I had and enjoyed the crabcakes. A good amount of crab, not too much breading at all. The roasted corn ancho chile sauce was a great compliment to them.
 
 Everyone else had steak and all loved it. The only complaint was the coffee and cocoa crusted flat iron steak was incredibly small. Temperatures ordered ranged from medium rare to medium well. It looked to me like everything was cooked less than requested but no one was upset at doneness. They looked delicious. It's a joy to see a well cooked steak. Made me wish i liked eating them.
 
 The cotton candy after the meal. Awesome. Would have skipped the underwhelming dessert had I know it was coming.
 
 The bad: We'd heard about how before ordering the meats were presented and explained. We did not get this service, but did see it other tables getting it.
 
 Our group's wine snob described the wine list as ""terrible."" Nobody likes him though. 
 
 Our waitress didn't seem to know what beers they had. The draft selection was limited to Bud's finest. When asked what they had in bottles she replied ""almost everything"" before shooting down several requests (Dogfish Head, Stella Artois, and Newcastle are a few I remember off the top of my head).
 
 The guys that ordered the french onion soup thought it was delicious, but were upset that it was barely warm to the point it was hard to break through the cheese.
 
 Dessert looked fantastic, but wasn't so good to eat. The chocolate cake is incredibly rich, but merely ok. The ""warmed"" apple tart came cold.
 
 They apparently don't believe in serving coffee with dessert either, as it came out a good 15 minutes after (and they neglected to offer milk or sugar). 
 
 If you're just going for dinner and aren't concerned about the extras (like service) the steaks were considered fantastic by all. If you want a full restaurant experience (as you should be entitled to for their prices) you might be better off finding another place in the city.",2,2,2,4
"Ken's nail salon is EXPENSIVE! I only go their on very SPECIAL occasions. The place is very clean and well kept, and the massage chairs are nice too.
 
 Drawback: For dropping over $80 for a pedi\/mani-acrylics, I would have expected it to last. After the first week with my acrylics, they started looking not-so-fresh. I felt like my arcrylics were over a month old, after only seven days. For paying top dollar I would have expected them to last. I have been to Ken's twice and have gotten the same services. Both experiences were the same. However, I can promise you will be very happy with the immediate results. 
 
 Overall, it's a good salon... but the prices are not worth paying for what you get.",2,2,5,5
"The D Grill had a really hip atmosphere and complements the rest of the casino well. However, one suggestion is that they brighten the lighting for breakfast. The dining area is extremely clean. 
 
 My breakfast came out quickly after I ordered. The service was efficient, just not friendly. My omelet was on par with other breakfast places. 
 
 The omelet was reasonably priced. However $4 for coffee is very expensive. It was worse than the instant I sometimes drink, too. A breakfast place should have coffee that is at least as good as Maxwell House.",3,2,4,5
"Their service deserved a 5 star. 
 
 The burger was bland, lacking in flavour. There wasn't that bbq smokey taste in the beef and all you taste is beef but none in flavouring. My husband tried the double burger with bacon and he said his was more bland but better than Five Guys. 
 
 I wouldn't go back but my husband would try it again.",2,2,2,2
"Would have given it one star, but the food quality was solid.
 
 The whole thing comes down to the stupid card concept and the over complicating of meal ordering. We go to Sweet Tomatoes\/Souplantation\/Souper Salad\/Fresh Choice BECAUSE IT'S A BUFFET!!!!! The idea that I need some carry a card around to track what I eat is ludicrous! Talk about over complicating things.
 
 Ordered the build your own salad and barely filled the bowl. Of course, only having like 6 leaves of romaine lettuce to get while there was a bucket of spinach didn't help the cause at all, but I digress. That was one card swipe and it covered the salad, soup, desert and bread. If I would have wanted to throw in a slice of pizza (which isn't there any more) that's another swipe; visit the rotisserie = another swipe. Go to the drink island (WTF!) that was another swipe. Point being is that if you're running a restaurant of any kind and can't track what's on a tray, then it's likely too complicated. Just the idea of not being to go to a soda fountain and not have glasses waiting is mind boggling.
 
 That said, the food was good, environment was nice, but way too uppity for what it is....A BUFFET!!!! Whoever the MBA that came up with this idea should be flogged and just reset it to what was. The price is certainly cheaper and while it's a one trip salad bar, you can load that mofo up and take home the extra. But still...who wants to do that at....A BUFFET! Oh...and another thing...why church up all the salad dressings? Is it too hard to just have Italian? Yep. Gotta have ""basalmic vinagrette,"" because Italian is too peasant-like or something.
 
 I suspect this place will be closed within 6 months. Sad because we actually liked Sweet Tomatoes.",2,3,2,2
"Family night out to try the all you can eat fish dinner and fish tacos. I am giving 2 stars for the food. It was really good as were the cocktails, even though they were overpriced at $10. The service needs some serious help. We waited 25 minutes to be seated and the restaurant wasn't full. They are understaffed and it is noticeable. The second order of my fish took 20 minutes to arrive. We won't be going back until they get more servers because fish tacos and fish dinner shouldn't take 2 hours.",2,2,2,2
"I visited Sonny's 2 weeks ago while visiting Charlotte from Boston. The place was clean and priced reasonably ($37 for 3adult--2 of that was lunch sized, 1 dinner sized, and 1 kids meal) the portion sizes were good. 
 
 Mac n cheese -- awesome, it consisted of real cheese and the blue boxed stuff
 
 Cornbread -- very, very good! I'm pretty sure there was some pig fat or grease baked into it! 
 
 Catfish-- was baked and completely covered with breadcrumbs. I was under the assumption that it was a baked on topping, something 'lighter'. It did taste good though.
 
 Water--was totally okay! I even had a lemon wedge in mine :)
 
 Beef brisket-- juicy, very good according to mom
 
 Roasted chicken(forgot the name) --- was alright, certainly nothing to brag about
 
 It's definitely not what expected for 'real' southern cooking, but I'd go back because it's cheap and more than edible. Oh and also for the cornbread!",3,5,3,3
"I visited Watermark Irish Pub with a group of 5 friends\/family on an August Saturday night.
 
 Location is great specially for people watching if your table is in the patio section.
 
 Service was really good as well.
 
 Food in the other hand was poorly prepared. I had one of their special burgers, the beef patty was tasteless! Side salad was decent but you have to pay an addition of $2 to get that salad with your burger, a total of $19! Fast foods sell much better burger! I would not go back to Watermark Irish Pub and do not recommend it just based on the food. 
 
 Other members of our party also didn't enjoy their meals!
 
 Just to be fair, I had a chocolate melty cake which was really good.",2,3,3,2
"Here on 4\/21\/12
 
 Just came in here to get a salad and soup. The place is loud , but not overtly so, and has a lot of colorful, odd, decor. If you bring kids ask to sit near the tree. It is. Manmade tree with all kinds of cool things and animals hanging from it.
 
 My salad was good, but lacked color. Lots of lettuce and 1 tiny grape tomato and 1 cucumber slice. I was disappointed. However, the balsamic vinigrette was very.good. as for the soup, I had the broccoli\/cheese which was tasty. I really wanted to know what the 'soup of the day' was, as it was stated on the menu, but apparently they only had the broccoli and cheese and french onion. No.daily soup specials.
 
 Overall satisfied withthis dining experience.",3,3,2,2
"I grabbed lunch here with my mom the other day and had a good time here. We wanted to get our grub on before getting our shop on at the Tanger Outlets. The restaurant had a cool vibe. I liked the interior mucho, ha! See what I did there? *cheesy grin*
 
 ANYWHO, we ended up ordering the Dance Marathon Enchilada (w\/ chicken, spinach, and portabella mushroom) and the Kristy's Big Sister's Red Velvet Quesadilla (chicken, grilled zucchini, spinach, pico de gallo and jack cheese). Oh, and I say ""we"" because my mom and I always split our food! 
 
 Let's start with the good. The quesadilla was AWESOME! Pipin' hot and perfectly cooked. I also LOVED the side of guac that accompanied the dish - probably the best guac I've had in years. FYI: it was a lunch special ($9.50) so it came with soup - you can also get salad if you wants. We went with the turkey chili, and it was RIDICULOUSLY tasty - lots of hearty filling with BAMF heat. 
 
 Unfortunately, my Enchilada was ""meh"". I feel bad because it was mad fresh with tons of grilled chicken and veggies, but it was tasteless. I had a really rough time finishing it. The beans and rice that came with it were even worse - pretty sure the rice was old because It was hard and dry.
 
 CONCLUSION: I'd definitely come back for the Quesadilla lunch special! I'd also be down to try the Fajitas out, but I won't be getting the Enchiladas anytime soon. Also, the happy hour seemed legit! Might be back to check that out with frands! Who knows...",3,2,4,4
"Nice looking restaurant. Great bar area. Very nice outdoor seating area as well, when the weather is nice. Very diverse menu ranging from burgers, fish tacos and steaks.
 
 Been here a few times. Always a good time. That said, not sure any of the entrees have ever stood out as great. Just okay or good. My last entree was the fish tacos. Probably will not order that again. Just okay.
 
 So in summary, very nice looking restaurant with decent food. Good for large parties as well.",3,4,3,3
"My shopping partner and I were at the mall when all of a sudden -simultaneously - we both got the urge for some beer and bar food. Hence, we found ourselves at the Yard House. It's in the mall. This was my second time (Indian Wells) and my friends first time. I told him that he was going to be in for a treat with the beer selection. Lo and behold they have over a 100 beers on DRAFT! It was a bit overwhelming so it took us almost 10 minutes to decide what drink to order. I got the Oregon honey and he got the half & half. Both of us were not disappointed. We ended up ordering several appetizers We got the sliders (ok, too much bread, not enough meat & side of fries), crab cakes (2 pieces, average tasting), lettuce wraps (grounded chicken with tofu, tasty), & the ahi tuna (unusually served as a round pie, good and super filling). This ended up being more than enough food for two people. It didn't stop there, though. We ordered the trio sample for dessert. We couldn't resist. It consisted of a small ramican of lemon souffle (yumm), chocolate fudge (yummier), and apple cobbler (heavenly). Overall, the service and food left us with a good stuffed feeling. I would definitely stop by and try it again. Unfortunately, we don't have one in the Bay Area. Wait, maybe that's a good thing?",3,5,3,2
"Nice place, good music (later), and overall enjoyed the ambience. Unfortunately some of the review are true, the food could be improved. Wanted to try something just to see if something like a special or app would be good, hot, and tasty. We tried the mussels along with wine of course. Enjoyed thew wine but the mussels were cold, they should have been hot. They weren't that busy on a Saturday night. They were also chewy much of the way thru. The wines by the glass are pretty good but I will say that several selections are overpriced. Go the the valley's other million wine bars and you'll see what I'm talking about. i will go along with some of the other review. Go there and drink, enjoy the music, and don't expect too much from the food. If the mussels were good we would have ordered a meal but that wasn't the case. Left and ate elsewhere.",3,2,3,3
"One of my somewhat regular stops. Bartenders always friendly and quick with the cold beers and stiff drinks. Poker machines haven't been kind to me. But when are they ever?
 
 It is one of those places where you order food and drink from different people and get different tabs. That confuses me because I am not that bright. Food is always fine, if not exceptional. But great stop for drinks, pool, darts and reflection on life's great dilemmas.",3,3,3,4
"Solid Korean place. Got their kimchi pork (jjim) as recommended and gamjatang. The gamjatang was pretty good and the soup was definitely higher quality than many other places. There was a good variety of side dishes. However, the service was subpar. I understand it is not fine dining, but messing up our order and then proceeding to play hide and seek with your customers is definitely not great.",3,2,3,3
"Just like everyone else has written, good food but TERRIBLE customer service.
 
 Their chicken wings are some of the best Chinese chicken wings around here. Their dishes are pretty decent.
 
 They look downtrodden. The lady is rude and has a serious attitude problem. The husband is no better. When I'd go there years ago, they seemed friendlier. Oh well, people change.",1,2,2,1
